    description: "<strong>Hikvision</strong> are the single biggest name in the security
      industry, with their cameras watching over everything from airports to football
      stadiums. It's no surprised then, that they are often at the cutting edge of
      surveillance technology. This 8 camera 4 megapixel security system is no exception,
      boasting network IP cameras that record amazing quality footage with even more
      detail than 1080p Full HD. It's a fantastic choice for demanding jobs such as
      monitoring a busy bar or shop.\r\n\r\nDon't be fooled by their small size, the
      8 bullet cameras included in the kit feature night vision for subjects up to
      30m away, allowing round the clock monitoring. They are also IP67 rated, allowing
      them to be installed in exposed outdoor locations. As IP cameras, they record
      lossless digital footage and send it down data cables directly to the recorder.\r\n\r\nThe
      kit also includes a professional grade Hikvision NVR, capable of recording the
      cameras at full resolution. Handily, the recorder features Power-over-Ethernet
      (PoE), letting it send power to the cameras over the network cables used to
      connect the kit together. As with all of our CCTV recorders, it's also kitted
      out with a complete suite of recording modes, including motion detection and
      7 day scheduling. Connect the NVR to your network router to enable remote access.
      Once configured this lets you watch live or recorded footage from anywhere using
      a PC or mobile device. This means that you can keep one eye on your property,
      no matter where you are!  \r\n\r\n<i>Some basic networking knowledge is recommended
      for configuring the remote access. If you need a bit of help getting it running
      then we also have a great remote setup service to get it all sorted for you.
