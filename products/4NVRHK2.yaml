    description: "This 4 camera Hikvision NVR boasts the latest recording technology,
      allowing it to capture and playback footage at up to 4K (8 megapixel) resolution.
      This means you can access security footage with <i>four times</i> the detail
      of 1080p Full HD. As is befitting a high end CCTV recorder, it's also kitted
      out with a complete range of adjustable recording settings. These include motion
      detection, scheduling and alarm outputs.\r\n\r\nTo make installation as easy
      as possible, the recorder features a 4 port PoE switch. This can power up to
      4 IP cameras using the ethernet network cables, preventing the need for external
      power supplies. To watch your cameras, you can either connect a TV or monitor
      using the HDMI connection, or plug the recorder into your router to enable remote
      access. This lets you view live or recorded footage from anywhere in the world
      using a PC or mobile device.\r\n\r\nThe recorder kit includes your choice of
      preinstalled hard drive storage. Just check the dropdown at the top of our page
      for our range of HDD options."
