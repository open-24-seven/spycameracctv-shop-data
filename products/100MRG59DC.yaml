    description: "Looking for an economical cabling solution for a large CCTV installation?
      This <strong>100m reel</strong> of shielded coaxial cable features parallel
      lines of RG59 and DC power wires, allowing you to use it to carry both video
      and power from your camera. This 2 way cable helps you save both money and time
      when wiring up a multi camera system. As this reel is completely uncut, it also
      provides much more flexibility than standard cables, as you can cut it to exactly
      the size you need on site!\r\n\r\nTo prepare the cable, all you need is to add
      a pair of our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/rg59-co-axial-coax-male-bnc-twist-on-connector-adapter-for-cctv-camera\"
      target=\"new\">twist fit BNC connectors</a> to the ends. These don't need any
      special tools to install, just a knife to cut back the flex. Then, just add
      a pair of our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/search/?search=powerjack\"
      target=\"new\">Power Jack connectors</a> to fit inn your 12V mains supply. Again,
      no special tools are required, it's no more tricky than wiring a stereo."
