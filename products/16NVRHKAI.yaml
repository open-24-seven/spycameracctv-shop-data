    description: "Hikvision has pioneered the use of video analytics in CCTV systems,
      providing intuitive ways to automate your property's security. Now, with their
      new <strong>DeepinMind</strong> series of recorders, they have unleashed a step
      change in how security systems manage and analyse video. The NVRs use deep learning
      - the same type of AI used to power voice assistants - in order to recognise
      and identify subject behaviour. In practical terms, this allows them to detect
      humans and trigger alarms & recording with significantly higher accuracy than
      other recorders on the market. When combined with Hikvision's high resolution
      IP cameras, this makes this 16 channel NVR an incredibly powerful security tool,
      suitable for perimeter defence and other demanding applications.\r\n\r\nThe
      NVR captures HD video from up to 16 cameras at a time, with a total incoming
      bandwidth of 256Mbps, and a huge 12MP maximum resolution. Perhaps unsurprisingly
      then, it also features 4 SATA hard drive bays, allowing a massive total storage
      of 40TB. It also supports Hikvision's advanced H.265+ video compression format,
      letting you record for up to 4 times longer for the same hard drive space. An
      HDMI output easily lets you monitor and playback footage in up to 4K resolution.\r\n\r\nThe
      NVR connects to your network allowing remote access via PC, or mobile device,
      and supports the full range of smart detection modes when used with Hikvision
      cameras. An intuitive interface allows you to search for trigger events, and
      even to search for events in specific area of an image. This makes it easier
      than ever to manage large numbers of cameras, and ensure that you don't miss
      any important events on your property.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"
