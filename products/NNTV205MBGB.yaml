    description: "Our discreet mini bullet spy camera allows you to perform covert
      surveillance without having to compromise on quality. We have installed a 2
      megapixel Panasonic imaging chip to capture the best images even at extremely
      low light levels. This removes the need for power-hungry infra-red LEDs that
      consume power and make the camera more noticeable to passers-by. \r\n\r\nThis
      high-resolution camera packs into a mini bullet camera form factor to ensure
      it doesn't attract attention to itself. The casing is IP66 rated meaning it
      is sealed from outside water ingress, making it suitable for outdoor usage.
      Due to its shape and the adjustable bracket, you can fit the camera into tight
      spaces and precisely point where you want the camera to look.\r\n\r\nWith 4-in-1
      compatibility, you can simply connect the camera to any CCTV recorder featuring
      a BNC connection to capture hours of footage. You can use one of our TVI recorders
      to record in resolutions up to 2MP or set it to CVBS mode to use with analogue
      recorders.\r\n\r\nWe have included an OSD controller so that you can fully control
      the camera's settings down-the-wire by using the mini joystick. This is important
      when it comes to setting it up with your recorder."
