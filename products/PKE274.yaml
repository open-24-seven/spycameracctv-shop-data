    description: "As the largest manufacturer of CCTV on the planet, Hikvision are
      constantly working to make their HD security systems accessible for the home
      user. Their HiWatch IP range is a perfect example of this, providing great value
      for money and simple installation, all without compromising on quality. This
      4 dome camera IP security system is one of the latest in this range, recording
      footage in crystal clear 1080p HD.\r\n\r\nThe kit includes 4 outdoor turret
      cameras, each housed inside of an IP67 rated weatherproof casing. Combined with
      their 30m night vision range, this makes them suitable for monitoring large
      unlit areas such as gardens or driveways. Their small size and wide angle lenses
      however make them great for indoor use as well. They record footage at 1920x1080
      resolution, enough to make out fine subject details during playback. The cameras
      are Power over Ethernet (PoE), meaning they draw power from the network cable
      rather than needing a separate power supply.\r\n\r\nAs well as 10m of waterproof
      cable per camera, the kit also includes an HD network video recorder (NVR) to
      store footage and automate recording. The recorder captures video at a maximum
      of 4 megapixel resolution, so there's no risk of losing quality from the cameras.
      It also has inputs for up to 8 cameras, letting you easily expand the system
      at a later date. As well as a host of adjustable recording an triggering settings,
      the NVR connects to your router to allow remote access. Once configured, you
      can use this to view your cameras live from anywhere using a PC or mobile device."
