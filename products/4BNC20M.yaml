    description: "This is a package of 4 x 20M cables to go with any CCTV security
      package. Simple plug and play cables.\r\n\r\nSimply choose from our wired camera
      section and Digital video recorders to complete your security package. These
      can be found in the menu on the left or the associated products on the right.\r\n\r\nThese
      cables are perfect when coupled with our 4 camera packs and the Digital Video
      Recorder of your choice. \r\n\r\nThese pre-made made cable lengths enable you
      to easily connect your CCTV camera's, recorders, monitors, DVR's etc. together.
      The video plugs are standard BNC connections for an excellent snug connection
      to your CCTV cameras and/or recorder. \r\n\r\nThe power comes with male to female
      2.1mm x 5.5mm DC coaxial connector which will suit 99% of standard CCTV cameras
      as an industry standard connection. \r\n\r\nWe do several lengths of cable from
      5m, 20m, 30m, 40m and 50m. Specialist lengths available on request.\r\n\r\nThese
      are very flexible cables, exceptional in delivering low loss signals over even
      the very longest cable runs and because they carry the video and the power,
      you only need to run 1 cable for your CCTV equipment.\r\n"
