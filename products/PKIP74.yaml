    description: "Hikvision are one of the most trusted names in CCTV and security,
      with cameras helping monitor properties all across the globe. This 4 megapixel
      IP security system uses their latest cameras and recorder to capture images
      with over twice the detail of 1080p HD. This helps ensure you can see extra
      fine subject detail, from faces to clothes and even licence plates. The dome
      cameras are an ideal fit for keeping a retail unit or small office building
      secure.\r\n\r\nEach turret camera is protected inside of an IP66 rated, weather
      proof housing, making them suitable for use both indoors and outdoors. The camera
      is fitted with an infra-red array, providing 30m of night vision illumination.
      This is essential for 24 hour security in unlit or outdoor areas. The camera
      also features a wide angle lens, and wide dynamic range recording, essential
      for areas with challenging high contrast lighting. This all means the cameras
      pack in a host of professional features despite their compact size.\r\n\r\nThe
      recorder features a built-in POE switch, letting it send power down the cable
      to the cameras. This is a massive benefit for installers, as it prevents the
      need to use individual power supplies for each camera. Crucially, connecting
      the NVR to your router will allow remote access. Once configured, this lets
      you watch live or recorded footage remotely over PC or mobile device. Other
      advanced recorder features include motion detection and scheduling, as well
      as alarm connections to integrate it with an external security system.\r\n"
