    description: "We always recommend using a junction box when installing a CCTV
      camera on the outside of a building. All of the cables that run to the camera
      can be connected inside the protective housing, shielding them from the weather
      and from anyone who might try and tamper with them. \r\n\r\nThis junction box
      is designed to work with most standard sized dome and turret cameras."
