    description: "1080p CCTV cameras are now more cost effective and easy-to-install
      then ever before, but even with these there are some applications that demand
      more resolution. This Hikvision 4K CCTV system features 2 bullet cameras recording
      8 megapixel video - <i>4 times</i> the detail of Full HD! This makes it ideal
      for demanding tasks such as monitoring a large outdoor area, recording crowds
      in detail, and even identifying specific faces.\r\n\r\nThe system includes 2
      heavy duty bullet cameras. Their IP67 rated housings are completely weatherproof,
      making them suitable for indoor or outdoor installation. The IP cameras use
      Power-over-Ethernet (PoE), meaning they draw power from the recorder via the
      network cable. This helps simplify setup by preventing the need for additional
      power supplies. As part of the latest generation of Hikvision IP cameras, they
      also boast a range of smart detection  features to automate recording, including
      face recognition and intruder detection.\r\n\r\nThe included network video recorder
      (NVR) is capable of recording both cameras at full resolution (3840x2160). Alternatively,
      you can also drop the resolution to allow recording from up to 6 additional
      cameras. The NVR connects to your router, allowing you, once configured, to
      remotely view your cameras from anywhere via a PC, Mac or mobile device. The
      recorder is pre-fitted with your choice of hard drive to hold footage."
