    description: "We were recently contacted by a customer with a big problem - stock
      was disappearing from their warehouse, and they were convinced that certain
      staff members were responsible. They needed a completely covert solution to
      catch them red-handed on camera, despite the warehouse being poorly lit. This
      kit was our solution, combining our smallest ever pinhole camera with a 4 channel
      CCTV recorder.\r\n\r\nAs well as being incredibly small, a Sony Exmor R sensor
      means the camera can keep recording video in light levels as low as 0.0008 lux
      - essential for badly lit interiors. Video is captured at 1080p Full HD quality,
      for images filled with usable subject detail. The pinhole lens means it can
      record through gaps as small as 2mm, helping keep the camera hidden away in
      a suspended ceiling, or on a shelf.\r\n\r\nAlso included is a 4 channel hybrid
      DVR from HiWatch, boasting a range of adjustable recording settings. These include
      motion detection, and a 24/7 recording schedule. The recorder is fitted with
      your choice of hard drive, whilst the extra channels mean that you can easily
      expand the system with additional cameras if needs be. Connecting the DVR to
      a router also allows you to configure remote access, to watch and control cameras
      from anywhere using a PC or mobile device. "
