    description: "This simple to use <strong>bird box camera for Mac</strong> is a
      great way for the whole family to watch nesting chicks and other wildlife. The
      kit combines our best selling wireless bird box camera with a Mac compatible
      Video Capture device. This provides an easy way of recording footage directly
      onto the hard drive of your Apple computer.\r\n\r\nThe kit's compact Wireless
      Camera is our most popular item, and can easily fit into most standard Nesting
      or Bird boxes. It's fitted with 6 Invisible Infra-Red LEDs, providing clear
      night vision without disturbing any wildlife. In addition, the camera's 2.8mm
      wide angle lens has been specially chosen to give a wide field of view when
      used inside a cramped box. It's even fitted with a tiny microphone, allowing
      you to listen to audio from inside the nest box! In order to help ensure the
      best possible image, we have also fitted the camera with a high grade sensor,
      recording at 700TVL.\r\nAs the camera features an integrated wireless transmitter,
      you can install it in your garden, and pick up the signal with the included
      receiver in your home. This means you only have to connect the camera to a power
      source, and prevents you needing to run video cables out to your garden.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera can transmit up 50m in clear line of sight. Solid obstructions such as
      walls will reduce this significantly, but it is still perfect for use in most
      gardens.\r\n\r\nOf course, what's really unique about this kit is the included
      Mac compatible USB Video Capture Device. This simple device allows you to record
      live video and audio from the receiver straight onto your Mac OS X computer
      (10.4.7 or later). This provides a quick and easy way of recording, at a fraction
      of the price of a dedicated Recorder! Unlike other devices on the market, this
      has been designed exclusively for Macs. The kit also comes with a suite of video
      editing software to allow you to quickly put together videos for your clips
      ready for upload."
