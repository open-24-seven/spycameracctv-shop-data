    description: "Larger properties such as warehouses or car parks can be hard to
      completely cover with CCTV, especially if you're a small business working with
      a limited budget. Luckily, we have put together this 16 camera HD CCTV system
      specifically with this situation in mind. The cameras are part of Hivkision's
      <strong>Easy TVI</strong> range, providing high resolution images and a simple
      setup, all at a price point that won't blow the bank.\r\n\r\nThe cameras each
      record in 1920x1080p Full HD, ensuring they can record detailed video with clearly
      defined subjects. The TVI video format means they connect to the recorder using
      simple twist fit BNC plugs and coaxial cable, and the plug-and-play setup means
      there's no confusing configuration needed to get it up and running. The cameras
      also boast weatherproof housings for outdoor use, and 40m night vision to enable
      round-the-clock security.\r\n\r\nAs a complete system, this kit includes everything
      you need to get it up and running, including a 250m cable reel, all required
      connectors, and a 16 channel CCTV DVR from Gamut. The hybrid recorder can capture
      1080p footage from each camera, so there is no loss of quality. We have pre-installed
      a huge 4TB hard drive for storage, however the DVR has 2 hard drive bays, allowing
      up to 12TB if more space is needed for recordings. Connect the DVR to your router
      to configure remote access, letting you watch live or recorded video from anywhere
      using a PC, phone or tablet.\r\n\r\n"
