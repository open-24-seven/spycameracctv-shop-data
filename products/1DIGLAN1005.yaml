  Professional grade wired security systems may provide unmatched resolution and control, but there are plenty of situations where they are just not practical, such as if you're renting a property, or if you need a quick DIY installation. If you need a flexible all-in-one solution, then this 1080p wireless CCTV kit is a great alternative. It's incredibly easy to set up, even for those of us without wiring knowledge, and the kit includes everything you need to get the camera up and running right out of the box.

  The camera records in 1080p Full HD, making it one of the highest resolution wireless kits on the market, and ensuring recordings are full of usable subject detail. The monitor can record from up to 4 cameras in 1080p, so you can easily expand your system. As well as IR LEDs for night vision, the camera also features a passive infrared (PIR) sensor. This can pick up the body heat of subjects within 5m, and use it to trigger recording. Footage is then transmitted to the monitor using digital wireless technology, providing a clean signal with greatly reduced risk of interference.

  The included monitor features a 9" touch screen, letting you easily set up recording and picture settings. Footage is then recorded to the built-in MicroSD card slot (card not included). A rechargeable battery even lets you pick up the screen and move about your house while in use. To enable mobile access, simply plug the screen into your router, and configure the camera using the free app. This lets you view live or recorded footage from wherever you are, using a phone or tablet.
