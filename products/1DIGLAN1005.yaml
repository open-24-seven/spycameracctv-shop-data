    description: "Professional grade wired security systems may provide unmatched
      resolution and control, but there are plenty of situations where they are just
      not practical, such as if you're renting a property, or if you need a quick
      DIY installation. If you need a flexible all-in-one solution, then this 1080p
      wireless CCTV kit is a great alternative. It's incredibly easy to set up, even
      for those of us without wiring knowledge, and the kit includes everything you
      need to get the camera up and running right out of the box.\r\n\r\nThe camera
      records in 1080p Full HD, making it one of the highest resolution wireless kits
      on the market, and ensuring recordings are full of usable subject detail. The
      monitor can record from up to 4 cameras in 1080p, so you can easily expand your
      system. As well as IR LEDs for night vision, the camera also features a passive
      infrared (PIR) sensor. This can pick up the body heat of subjects within 5m,
      and use it to trigger recording. Footage is then transmitted to the monitor
      using digital wireless technology, providing a clean signal with greatly reduced
      risk of interference.\r\n\r\nThe included monitor features a 9\" touch screen,
      letting you easily set up recording and picture settings. Footage is then recorded
      to the built-in MicroSD card slot (card not included). A rechargeable battery
      even lets you pick up the screen and move about your house while in use. To
      enable mobile access, simply plug the screen into your router, and configure
      the camera using the free app. This lets you view live or recorded footage from
      wherever you are, using a phone or tablet. "
