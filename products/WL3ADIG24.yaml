    description: "Horse foaling season can be an incredibly stressful time of year
      when you are responsible for the welfare of Mares. Add in the fatigue from having
      to observe barns across a large property at all hours, and the result is often
      a testing time for breeders. With these specific needs in mind, our security
      camera experts have put together this powerful digital wireless CCTV system.
      Now you can <i>remotely</i> monitor your mares from the comfort of your home
      with high resolution video and clear audio.\r\n\r\nWhilst the kit was initially
      built with foaling in mind, it has also proved popular as a calving or lambing
      camera, and even just for wildlife observation.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the kit is
      a robust, weather-resistant CCTV camera suitable for mounting indoors or outside,
      exposed to the worst of the elements. The camera is fitted with infrared (IR)
      LEDs, providing enough night vision illumination to clearly see subjects up
      to 20m away, even in total darkness. This compact camera records full colour
      video at 700TV lines, guaranteeing crisp images with sharp detail. We have also
      included a tiny CCTV microphone to record audio from the barn. This is essential
      when you want to ensure you are following everything that happens.\r\n\r\nUniquely,
      the transmitter and receiver pack included in this package use digital wireless
      technology, preventing the signal interference that can often be a problem when
      using similar analogue hardware. Even in an area with many WiFi networks, the
      advanced transmitter guarantees a clear picture with no noise or banding. An
      added benefit is that this also boosts the signal's range, allowing unobstructed
      use from up to 200m away! The transmission is also encrypted, so once you have
      paired the transmitter and receiver together, other users will not be able to
      intercept your video!\r\n\r\nEven if you have never set up a CCTV system before,
      don't worry! All of our security camera systems are all-inclusive kits, and
      we have gone to great lengths to make sure they're as easy as possible to put
      together. All cables and connectors are included, and it's simply a matter of
      connecting the camera & transmitter to the 12V power supplies. The receiver
      can then plug straight into your television, to give you a quick and easy way
      of staying close to your livestock at this vital time.\r\n\r\nWe have taken
      care to ensure this system perfectly fits the needs of horse foaling, calving,
      and lambing, but it also makes a versatile solution to many wireless CCTV needs.
      In particular, it has proved a popular kit for remotely viewing night time wildlife."
