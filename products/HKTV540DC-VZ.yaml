    description: "Boasting exceptional image quality and remote zoom control, this
      professional grade dome camera is one of the most versatile in Hikvision's Turbo
      HD range. It's suitable for a host of demanding applications such as car park
      or warehouse security. And what's more, all of this is possible for a significantly
      lower cost than an equivalent IP camera. \r\n\r\nThe camera captures footage
      in 2560x1944 resolution - or 5 megapixels - providing images with over twice
      the amount of subject detail as Full HD. Hikvision's advanced EXIR night vision
      LEDs provide 40m of clear night vision, allowing use in completely unlit areas.
      The camera is also fitted with a 2.8-12mm motorised zoom, letting you remotely
      change the field of view from a compatible recorder. All of this is housed inside
      a weatherproof and vandalproof dome casing.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Turbo-HD range,
      the camera uses HD-TVI technology to send high resolution video down a standard
      BNC cable. This means it's plug-and-play, with no complex configuration required
      to get it running on your recorder. It even uses power-over-coax (POC), letting
      it draw power from a compatible DVR over the RG59 cable, and removing the need
      for an additional power supply (requires compatible DVR).\r\n\r\n"
