    description: "Night vision is essential when using CCTV to monitor unlit areas
      such as gardens and driveways, however, the IR LEDs built into cameras do have
      their limitations. They are often not powerful enough for larger areas, and
      usually, have a very narrow field of view. This powerful IR illuminator is a
      great way to extend your system's coverage. \r\n\r\nThe weather-resistant bank
      of IR LEDs is mounted on an adjustable bracket, letting you easily direct them
      towards the desired subject. This provides a versatile independent source of
      light, which you can use to light up certain areas of the image, or even just
      extend the range of your cameras. The floodlight can illuminate subjects up
      to 50m away and will work with almost all CCTV cameras."
