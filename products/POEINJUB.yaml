    description: "This compact PoE converter is a perfect accessory to an outdoor
      wifi bridge. It can take 802.3af PoE from a device such as a <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spy/accessories/networking/switch/\"
      target=\"_blank\">network switch</a> and convert it to passive. This lets you
      power a host of devices that would otherwise need a separate PoE injector plugged
      into the mains, helping reduce the number of cables that you need to run to
      the outside of your property.\r\n\r\nCrucially, the converter is housed inside
      of a totally weatherproof casing, making it perfect for installation in exposed
      outdoor locations. A rubber gasket prevents water accessing the ethernet port,
      but this does also mean the device cannot be used with pre-terminated cables."
