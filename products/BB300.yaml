    description: "Our Green Feathers team has over a decade's experience designing
      and selling camera kits for watching wildlife and birds. Now we have teamed
      up with the folks over at Riverside Woodcraft to produce our first bird house,
      designed from the ground up to be perfect for setting up a bird box camera.
      It's a perfect project for families or schools, letting you watch in amazing
      detail, as birds investigate the box, then build a nest and raise their chicks.\r\n\r\nThe
      box itself is incredibly solid, built from 21mm thick wood, unlike most of the
      thinner, less durable boxes on the market. Importantly, it also carries the
      FSC label, ensuring the timber only comes from responsible sources. Not only
      that, but all of the boxes are handmade in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the
      box has been designed to be as spacious as possible, leaving room for installation
      of your camera. There is a small mounting hole in the back of the box, perfectly
      sized to fit the camera's bracket. Slots run underneath either side of the roof
      to add ventilation for the birds, and also providing a neat way to route power
      and video cables out of the box. The kit also includes a set of mounting plates
      and screws, letting you easily attach the box to a tree."
