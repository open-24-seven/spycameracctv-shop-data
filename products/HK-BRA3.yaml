    description: "Junction boxes are an essential addition to any IP camera that is
      being installed on an exterior wall. This Hikvision model is compatible with
      their 30m night vision dome cameras, and helps provide protection for the ethernet
      and power connections.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, it means you can install the camera
      without having to drill a huge hole in the exterior wall to feed through the
      ethernet connector, helping make installation much simpler."
