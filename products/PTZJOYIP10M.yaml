    description: This is an optional extra for our wireless PTZ IP camera systems,
      providing an easy way to precisely control the camera movements. The joystick
      can be connected to one of the wifi bridges using the included Cat6 cables.
      The router can either connect into the joystick in turn, or directly into the
      wifi bridge.
