    description: "Bundled with our best-selling Green Feathers brand wireless bird
      box camera is a USB video capture device for recording footage of your birds
      to your Windows PC. You can now watch your footage of your garden birds building
      their nest and raising their young from your laptop or PC and record it all
      to watch later. \r\n\r\nThis is an easy-to-use, plug-and-play kit that allows
      wildlife recording without the expense of a fully-fledged DVR. Our 700 TV line
      wireless bird box camera provides a wide-angle field-of-view and night vision.
      This, coupled with the fact that the camera measures just 42 mm by 35 mm, makes
      it an ideal camera that neatly screws into small bird boxes. \r\n\r\nWireless
      transmission from the bird box camera provides a range of up to 50 metres in
      clear line-of-sight to the receiver from where you connect it to your TV (via
      RCA/SCART) for live viewing and the USB Capture Device for recording.\r\n\r\nThe
      USB Capture Device includes free <strong>iSpy software</strong> that features
      advanced recording options such as motion detection and scheduled recording
      so that you can configure recording to your specification. Footage is recorded
      to the hard drive so that you can return to view it at anytime. Furthermore
      you can export footage to upload to YouTube and the Cloud. Please note that
      this is third party software and we do not support all features.\r\n\r\nTo download
      the software follow <a href=\"http://www.ispyconnect.com/download.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">this
