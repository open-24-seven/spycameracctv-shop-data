    description: "With their latest range of HiWatch cameras and recorders, Hikvision
      have taken the exceptional image quality that has made their professional CCTV
      equipment the industry standard, and brought it to the home user. The cameras
      record in crisp and clear 1080p HD (or 2 megapixel) resolution, with more than
      enough subject detail to keep your property safe.\r\n\r\nDon't let the price
      fool you though - the camera is still packed with professional grade features.
      Night vision is provided by powerful EXIR LEDs with 40m range, designed to provide
      even illumination across the image, even in the corners. Hikvision's Smart IR
      feature also helps improve night vision recording, by dimming the light for
      subjects closer to the camera. The IP66 rated housing is completely weatherproof,
      ensuring it can be installed indoors or outdoors.\r\n\r\nThe camera's 4-in-1
      technology means it works with pretty much every video format that uses a BNC
      coaxial cable, so you don't worry about compatibility if you're adding it to
      an existing system. What's more,  you don't have to worry about configuring
      it after installation, just plug it in to your recorder or monitor and you're
      away."
