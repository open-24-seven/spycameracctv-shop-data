    description: "<strong>B-grade 25% off</strong>\r\nThis product is a customer return
      or ex-display model. The packaging will have been opened but the contents have
      been fully tested. It might have minor cosmetic defects.\r\n\r\nThis IP dome
      camera from Hikvision, the worldâ€™s largest manufacturer of CCTV equipment,
      is excellent as a standalone camera or as part of a larger system. The headline
      feature of this camera is that it has built-in WiFi. This means if you are within
      a range of 50 metres you can connect directly to it or you can configure it
      to connect to your WiFi network. This allows you to access the camera remotely
      to change settings at a touch of the button using a PC or smartphone. Footage
      can be recorded on the camera without the need for a separate recorder thanks
      to the MicroSD card that supports cards up to 128GB in capacity. Featuring an
      Ethernet port with PoE support this surveillance camera also fully integrates
      with NVRs as part of a complete CCTV system.\r\n\r\nThe camera captures video
      at a resolution of 4-megapixels for crisp and detailed video, which is more
      than enough quality for police use. Infra-red night vision LEDs provide a 30-metre
      range for use in unlit areas and at night. As standard, this camera is fitted
      with a 2.8mm lens providing a wide-angle field of view. All of this is housed
      in a secure metallic weatherproof housing rated IP66 and vandal proof.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera can be powered over Ethernet removing the need for a separate power supply,
      which makes set up simple. Using the Hikvision app on your smartphone you can
      view the camera remotely wherever you are in the world and tweak settings.\r\n"
