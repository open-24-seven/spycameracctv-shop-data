    description: "Wireless CCTV systems are some of our most popular kits, and for
      good reason: they are perfect for areas where you can't run cables directly
      to a recorder, or for when you might need to move a camera to a different location.
      Compared to wired cameras, there are some limitations, as they typically can't
      transmit images of the same resolution as the wired version, and carry a risk
      of potential wireless interference. But there's a way around this! This discreet
      Hikvision WiFi camera system uses IP cameras that connect to a recorder via
      your building's wireless network. \r\n\r\nConnecting via WiFi allows the cameras
      to work at significantly higher resolutions than traditional wireless cameras,
      up to 4 megapixels (2688x1520), or twice that of Full HD. It also means you
      are using an existing wireless signal, rather than broadcasting a new one that
      could be prone to interference. All you need to do, is check that there is decent
      signal at the location you want to install each camera (using a phone is a great
      way to check this), and that you can reach it with the included 12V power cable.
      The cameras are first plugged into the recorder for an initial configuration,
      then after that connect using Wifi.\r\n\r\nThe recorder itself is a professional
      grade HD model from Hikvision, capable of recording full resolution footage
      from each camera without any loss in quality. The kit also includes your choice
      of pre-installed hard drive for storage (you can select this in the handy drop-down
      menu above). The network video recorder connects to your router, letting you
      watch your cameras or recordings from anywhere using a PC, phone or tablet.
      The PC app even lets you configure Hivkision's smart detection features, including
      line crossing, object removal and instrusion detection."
