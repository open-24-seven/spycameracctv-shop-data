    description: "<strong>Who is this service right for?</strong>\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Users
      with one IP camera connected directly to their network</li>\r\n\r\n<strong>Who
      is this service not right for?</strong>\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Users with more than 1 camera</li>\r\nâ€¢
      Systems with a remote access DVR or NVR</li>\r\n\r\n<i>For these situations
      we recommend our silver, gold or platinum support packages, depending on the
      number of cameras you have</i>\r\n\r\nIP cameras are a great tool for securely
      monitoring your property whilst away, but they can sometimes be confusing to
      get up and running for people with no experience with networking or routers.
      That's why our simple to use remote setup service takes away the technical hassle
      of configuring an IP camera for viewing over the internet or on mobile.\r\n\r\nAfter
      the initial setup, a simple annual Direct Debit subscription will then be set
      up for continued remote access via a secure web address. \r\n\r\nLogging in
      remotely to your computer, one of our tech support agents will completely configure
      your software and router, as well as setting up a web address through which
      you can securely log in to see your camera's feed. The service usually takes
      around 30 minutes, during which time you can get our support agent to guide
      you through the process on the phone, or alternatively leave them to it if you'd
      prefer to have a cup of tea!\r\n\r\nThe service can also configure mobile access
      of your camera, setting it up so you can view it live on iOS, Android or Windows
      phone devices (depending on the camera's compatibility), allowing live viewing
      even when on-the-go. It also covers continuing remote support for the first
      month in case there are any initial teething troubles with the connection.\r\n\r\n<i>After
      purchasing, just <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/contact.php\">give
      us a call</a> and arrange a time for the set up that best suits you</i>"
