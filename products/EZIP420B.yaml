    description: "The best selling <strong>HiWatch</strong> range brings Hikvision's
      advanced CCTV technology to the DIY and home user, with high resolution video
      and simple installation. This 4 megapixel IP camera is a great example, capturing
      2560x1440 images with twice the detail of 1080p Full HD.\r\n\r\nAs well as punching
      above its weight on picture quality, the compact camera also features infrared
      LEDs that provide 20m night vision range. Combined with Hikvision's own 3D DNR
      noise reduction technology, this helps ensure video is clean and detailed at
      all hours of the day. The camera is also housed in a robust IP67 rated weatherproof
      housing, allowing installation indoors or outdoors. \r\n\r\nThe camera supports
      Power-over-Ethernet (or \"PoE\"). This means it can draw power down the cable
      from compatible switches or recorders, instead of needing a dedicated mains
      plug. Once the IP camera is configured to your network, you can watch it from
      anywhere using a PC or mobile app. The software even lets you set up recording
      to a PC, unlocking features such as motion detection without needing a dedicated
      recorder."
