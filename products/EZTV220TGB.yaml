    description: "The best selling HiWatch range has been put together by Hikvision
      to help you secure your property without needing an expensive installation,
      or a complex configuration. This HD turret camera is small & discreet - a fantastic
      option for keeping watch over your home or a small shop.\r\n\r\nThe camera captures
      footage in 1920x1080 Full HD, helping ensure that all of your footage is packed
      with usable detail. As standard they're preset to use the HD-TVI format, but
      the 4-in-1 technology can also be set to AHD, CVI, or CVBS.  This means that
      they're cross compatible with a huge range of surveillance equipment, and can
      easily be added to an existing system. Importantly, they are plug-and-play,
      so there's no confusing networking required to get them up and running.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera is fitted with infrared LEDs to provide 20m night vision range. And what's
      more, the housing is rated IP66 weather proof. This means they can keep watch
      over your property 24 hours a day, all year round."
