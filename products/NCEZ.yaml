    description: "Our best selling Green Feathers wireless bird box camera has long
      been a firm favourite with nature lovers, letting you easily watch live as birds
      nest, hatch and fledge, all from the comfort of your living room. Now we have
      paired our most popular camera with a digital video recorder from Hikvision,
      making it easy to record and archive footage, and even to view your camera remotely
      on a PC or mobile.\r\n\r\nThe kit includes a tiny wireless camera, easily installed
      in any standard garden bird box or bird house. It uses a wide angle lens and
      night vision LEDs to capture everything happening in the box, even in the dead
      of night. Don't worry though, the LEDs use invisible infrared, so there won't
      be any visible red glow that might disturb the chicks' sleep. This video footage
      is then transmitted back to the included wireless receiver. The wireless works
      over distances up to 50m, but solid obstructions such as walls will reduce this,
      so always try and set up the receiver as close as possible to the box.\r\n\r\nThe
      DVR is designed by Hikvision, the largest name in CCTV technology. The receiver
      connects to one of the 4 video channels, letting you easily set up scheduled
      and motion detection recording. Simply choose a hard drive from the drop down
      menu, and we will pre-install this before shipping the recorder out to you.
      The DVR can also be connected to your internet router. Once configured, this
      lets you log in and view the bird box from anywhere in the world using a PC
      or mobile device.\r\n\r\n"
