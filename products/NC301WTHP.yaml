    description: Meet our camera designed for parrot breeders. Parrots are notorious
      for scraping their nest box to create nest lining as well as destroying any
      non-natural looking objects placed in their nest box. To combat this the camera
      features a recessed bracket, which gives several benefits. It means the camera
      doesn't consume any space in the bird box but more importantly it makes it impossible
      for any feathered residents to damage it. Additionally by mounting the camera
      in the roof of a nest box it allows you to utilise this camera's wide angle
      lens to the fullest and enjoy a full corner to corner view of the nest box.
