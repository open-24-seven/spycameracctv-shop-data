    description: "Pan-tilt-zoom (or \"PTZ\") CCTV cameras are mounted on motorised
      bases, letting you remotely control where they are looking. They're a fantastic
      option for monitoring larger outdoor spaces that would otherwise need multiple
      cameras, or for tracking moving subjects such as cars in car park. This PTZ
      camera is housed in a bullet style casing, lending it an imposing presence when
      mounted to the outside of a building, ideal for deterring intruders or vandals
      - when this thing turns to look at them, you can be sure that they know they're
      on camera!\r\n\r\nThe camera is built around a professional grade Sony imaging
      chip, letting it capture footage in 1080p Full HD. When combined with the 10x
      zoom lens, this allows you to view exceptional detail from even distant subjects.
      The camera is also fitted with powerful infra red LEDs that focus with the lens,
      allowing up to a huge 100m range at the top end of the zoom.\r\n\r\nThe IP camera
      connects to your building's network router using a standard ethernet cable.
      Once configured, you can view and control the camera remotely using a free PC
      or mobile app, or by connecting it to a network video recorder. You can even
      use it with one of our PTZ joysticks, providing fingertip control over the camera's
      movements. The camera's movements can also be automated, with 220 programmable
      positions, as well as up to 3 tours."
