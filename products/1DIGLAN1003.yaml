    description: "When looking for a new home CCTV system, choices can be daunting-
      it's vital to pick a kit that has enough features and control to monitor your
      home effectively, but many fully featured systems are far too complex to set
      up without professional help. That's where this <strong>HD Digital Wireless
      CCTV Kit</strong> comes into it's own. The kit boasts a host of unique security
      features, all controlled by one central device, so there's no need to trail
      cables everywhere. This makes it ideal for people looking for a first security
      kit who want to avoid a stressful setup.\r\n\r\nUniquely, the cameras are capable
      of recording at an impressive 720p HD resolution, previously unheard of for
      wireless CCTV kits! The extra detail this records means the resulting security
      footage will be much more useful if you have to go back and review it should
      the worst happen. If you want to expand the system at a later date, up to 2
      cameras are supported at full 720p resolution, or up to 4 at standard definition.
      The camera also has a built in PIR sensor, allowing it to detect a subject's
      body heat, and use it to trigger recording- a much more reliable system than
      standard motion detection! The feature packed camera is finished off with a
      ring of IR LEDs, providing clear night vision of subjects up to 10m away.\r\n\r\nFootage
      from the camera is then transmitted to the recorder/monitor using advanced Digital
      Wireless technology. This pairs the devices together in order to send the video
      signal across a wide range of frequencies, both helping reduce the risk of wireless
      interference and making sure that no other users can pick up your camera's signal.\r\n\r\nThe
      recording device itself combines a wireless receiver with a MicroSD DVR and
      a 9\" colour LCD. This means everything you need to record and view the cameras
      is in one single device. To make it even more versatile, the screen has an internal
      battery, allowing you to unplug the device and move it around your house without
      any constrictions. Additional features also include an automatic power save
      function and even a talkback mode, using the small speaker built into the camera.
      Footage is stored to the built-in MicroSD card slot (supports up to 64GB, card
      not included), capable of holding many days' worth of footage. For mobile security,
      connecting the device to your internet router and scanning the included QR code
      lets you watch live footage from your camera on a smartphone or tablet."
