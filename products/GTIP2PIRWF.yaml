    description: "Sometimes you just need to take extra care when there's reason to
      be suspicious. Whether it's covertly monitoring a stockroom or catching theft
      in an office, some security applications simply need cameras that don't attract
      unwanted attention. This PIR sensor camera is a perfect solution, offering a
      standalone device that boasts many of the same recording features as a full
      system. It even features WiFi access, so you can connect remotely to watch footage
      from your camera without needing any indiscreet network cables trailing from
      the device.\r\n\r\nThe camera itself records crisp, full-colour footage in 1920x1080
      Full HD resolution, ensuring that any footage is full of usable subject detail.
      Everything is captured through a tiny pinhole lens, pointing out of a miniscule
      hole on the face of the sensor. The imaging chip is sensitive enough to work
      in conditions as dark as 0.5 lux, or can be paired with an additional <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/50m-ir-illuminator-led-security-floodlight-night-vision-cctv\"
      target=\"_blank\">infrared illuminator</a> to work in complete darkness. \r\n\r\nThe
      IP camera is designed to connect to your network router, letting you log in
      and securely watch live or recorded footage from anywhere, using a PC or mobile
      device (iOS or Android). The camera needs to be plugged in to your router for
      an initial configuration, then after that, it can work from WiFi, connected
      to nothing but power. It even features a MicroSD card slot, letting you record
      clips of footage without an external CCTV recorder. Recording settings include
      a full range of motion detection and scheduling options. Please note: card not
      included."
