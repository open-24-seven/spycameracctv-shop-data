    description: "The <strong>HiWatch</strong> range of cameras and recorders has
      been put together by Hikvision to bring the reliable build and clear image quality
      of their commercial cameras to home and DIY users. This 2 camera CCTV kit is
      a great example, combining compact turret cameras with a 4 channel recorder.
      They both use standard twist-fit BNC cables, so it's a great option if you want
      to upgrade an existing older CCTV kit to HD.\r\n\r\nThe turret cameras are discreet
      but rugged, making them a popular choice for small shops & newsagents as well
      as homes. They're protected by an IP66 rated housing, providing full weather
      resistance and allowing use indoors or out. Infrared LEDs combine with a 1080p
      imaging sensor, allowing the camera to capture clear round-the-clock images
      of subjects.\r\n\r\nThe included HiWatch DVR boasts a range of recording features
      to automate your home's security, including motion detection and 7 day scheduling.
      Footage is recorded to the internal hard drive - just select which size you
      need from the drop down at the top of the page. The DVR has 4 channels, allowing
      you to easily expand your system with 2 additional cameras at any time. Connect
      the DVR to your internet router in order to view cameras and adjust settings
      remotely from a PC or mobile device."
