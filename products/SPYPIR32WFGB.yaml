    description: "Looking completely inconspicuous in any office or shop, this discreet
      PIR sensor actually conceals an advanced 720 HD Wireless IP Camera, complete
      with Motion Detection. This is actually the latest in our popular range of <a
      href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spy/spy-cameras/home-office-spy-cameras/wireless-camera/\"
      title=\"WiFi Spy Cams\">WiFi Spy cams</a>. These ingenious devices allow you,
      after a one time set up, to log in and watch & record footage in real time over
      the internet. As the camera uses a WiFi connection, there is less risk of a
      \ suspicious cable giving away it's location!\r\n\r\nThis camera is completely
      camouflaged inside of a standard sized PIR sensor casing. Whilst the PIR is
      non-functional, it looks perfectly at home discreetly mounted on a wall in an
      office or retail space. All the camera needs is a tiny pinhole in the front
      of the case in order to record through.\r\n\r\nDespite its small size, the camera
      manages to fit in a professional quality CMOS imaging chip. This unit can record
      crisp full colour images in 1280x720 HD quality. This easily exceeds the standard
      recommended by police for effective evidence gathering, and helps ensure any
      footage has usable detail.\r\n\r\nOnce installed, the camera just has to be
      connected to your internet router via a cable in order to be initially configured.
      Once this has been done, the cable can be disconnected and the camera can be
      used with a wireless connection. The included software allows a host of professional
      features including adjustable Motion Detection and scheduled recording. Footage
      can then be recorded directly onto your computer's hard drive, or to the built-in
      MicroSD card slot (please note cards not included). As well as PCs, this camera
      can be viewed over mobile devices such as iPhones, iPads and Android handsets,
      allowing you to keep a close eye on your belongings wherever you are!"
