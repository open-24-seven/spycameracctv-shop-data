      plate information from vehicles captured by the camera(s). Based on IP technology
      the NVR records Full 1080p HD images from cameras with a resolution of up to
      6 megapixels. Furthermore, the NVR supports 16 independent PoE channels allowing
      you to power up to 16 IP cameras without additional power cabling. \r\n\r\nThe
      recorder boasts a new GUI interface and intuitive video content analysis modes
      for a range of security applications. Pre-installed with a 2TB hard drive for
      plenty of recording storage, the NVR allows full-quality HD recording and synchronous
      playback of up to 16 cameras. Supporting up to 4 hard drives with a capacity
