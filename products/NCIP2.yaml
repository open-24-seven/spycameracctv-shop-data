    description: "Our exclusive Green Feathersâ„¢ range of dedicated bird box cameras
      is the culmination of a decade of experience providing specialist equipment
      for watching wildlife. This IP bird box camera can be installed in any standard
      sized nest box, letting check in on hatching eggs & feeding chicks in HD quality
      from anywhere, using a PC, phone or tablet.\r\n\r\nThe camera captures digital
      footage in 1080p resolution, recording significantly more detail than older
      analogue models. We've fitted it with a 2.8mm wide angle lens - ensuring it
      can see all of even the most cramped boxes - and invisible IR LEDs that provide
      clear night vision without disturbing the birds. The camera also has a tiny
      microphone to record audio.\r\n\r\nThe camera works using Power-over-Ethernet,
      drawing power directly from the network cable. This does require a PoE compatible
      network switch or CCTV recorder, however if you don't have one of these then
      we also have a <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/hd-ip-bird-box-camera-960p-mobile-ipad-access\">camera
      kit with a separate power supply</a>. \r\n\r\nOnce configured to your network,
      you can easily log in and view live footage from the PC or mobile apps. These
      also let you record video clips and, when combined with a NAS drive, set up
      motion detection to make sure you don't miss anything happening in the box.
      Complete instructions for configuring the camera are providing at our <a href=\"https://help.spycameracctv.com/?s=NCIP9\"
      target=\"_blank\">help page</a>, or we also have a remote setup service if you
      would prefer us to adjust the network settings."
