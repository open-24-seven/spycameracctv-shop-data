    description: "Where's the most effective place to hide something? In plain sight.
      \r\n\r\nThis unassuming disposable coffee cup conceals a tiny HD spy camera
      inside the lid, making it the ideal tool for covert surveillance on the street,
      or in the office. A small pinhole lens on the side of the plastic lid captures
      everything within a 66 degree field of view from the side of the cup. What's
      more, the camera and lid fit most 90mm cups, allowing use with take away drinks
      from all high street chains.\r\n\r\nThe camera records video in 1080p HD quality,
      ensuring you capture plenty of identifiable subject detail. It's powered by
      a small rechargeable battery, allowing up to 180 minutes of continuous recording
      to MicroSD card (card not included).It even has a Wifi connection, letting you
      easily view images and control recording from a mobile phone or tablet."
