    description: "Versatile recording, triggering modes, AND the portability of a
      compact device? Welcome to our range of battery-powered spy cameras! These cameras
      have proven themselves to be our most popular and reliable covert recording
      solution. This new flagship addition to the range takes this template and adds
      unique features, such as a PIR sensor for motion detection, and alarm connections.
      If you're looking for a powerful security solution, look no further. This powerful
      feature combination is ideal for either using it as a standalone camera in the
      home, or integrated into an existing alarm system in a business setting.\r\n\r\nCheck
      out the camera's handy multiple triggering modes it can use to start recording.
      Most prominently, the front of the camera is now fitted with a PIR (Passive
      Infrared) sensor, letting it detect changes in temperature caused by a subject's
      body heat. This can then be used to trigger motion detection recording, and
      is far less prone to \"accidental\" recordings than other types of motion detection.
      In addition, the camera boasts sound activation, vibration detection and traditional
      motion detection - all of which can be activated or disabled separately using
      the free software widget available on the manufacturer's website. \r\n\r\nAnother
      new addition is the camera's <strong>alarm connections</strong>. The device
      has inputs and outputs, allowing you to set it up to be triggered by door sensors
      or smoke detectors as part of a large alarm system, something completely unique
      for a battery-powered recorder! The battery itself is a rechargeable Lithium-Ion
      unit, capable of recording up to 24 hours of continuous footage on one charge.
      But watch this: when combined with the PIR or vibration detection mode, it can
      remain \"armed\" on standby for months at a time!\r\n\r\nAnother fine new feature
      is the inclusion of infrared LEDs, providing one of the most compact night vision
      cameras in our entire range! The LEDs even use 940nm \"invisible\" IR, meaning
      there is no telltale red glow to give away the camera's location to its subjects,
      also called 'no-glow'. The camera can record up to 720p HD resolution, capturing
      footage directly to an internal MicroSD card slot (<i>Please note, the card
      is not included</i>). This may well make it our most versatile and advanced
      standalone video recorder!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
