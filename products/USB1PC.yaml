    description: "This USB Video Capture Device allows you to record video and audio
      from any spy camera or device that uses RCA/phono connectors to your Windows
      PC. The key benefit of this device is its ease of use: just connect it to your

      solutions this saves you from requiring a costly CCTV DVR to record your footage.\r\n\r\nThis

      options such as motion detection and scheduled recording so that you can configure
