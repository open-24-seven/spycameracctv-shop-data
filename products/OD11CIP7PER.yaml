    description: "<strong>B-Grade Product: 60% off</strong>\r\nThis product has either
      been opened, returned by customers, are ex-display or have been used for technical
      testing. All products have had some use, some may have cosmetic damage, such
      as screw fixings damage.\r\n\r\nThis <strong>IP dome security camera</strong>
      records detailed HD footage, and can easily be set up to stream live over the
      internet. Unlike analogue CCTV cameras, IP cameras record footage digitally,
      and then outputs it via a network connection. This not only lets them capture
      more fine detail than traditional equipment, but means you can connect them
      directly to your router for live online viewing without the need for a separate
      DVR. This makes this camera a great value option for anyone looking to start
      an IP system, and perfect for offices or retail spaces.\r\n\r\nThe camera's
      all digital imaging system allows it to record footage in full colour 1280x720
      HD, showing a significant step up in improvement from even the highest quality
      analogue cameras. This provides much more fine detail in the video images, helping
      you keep an eye on everything that happens on your property. This high resolution
      video can be recorded whilst simultaneously viewing lower resolution streams
      on PC or mobile.  \r\n\r\nEarlier models of IP camera had quite an involved
      set up, making them highly impractical for users without a good knowledge of
      networking, IP addresses and so on. We have designed this range of cameras to
      have a simple software set up once connected to your router, and include step
      by step instructions in plain English. Once configured you can view live footage,
      and make recordings using the included software. For 24/7 monitoring however,
      we recommend using our dedicated NVR. The camera is also ONVIF compatible, meaning
      you can use it with most NVRs on the market.\r\n\r\nThe camera itself is housed
      in a durable dome casing, helping keep it discreet when mounted from a suspended
      ceiling or on a wall. The housing is even weather proof to the IP66 standard,
      allowing it to be installed in exposed outdoor locations. It is fitted with
      a ring of IR LEDs, providing 10m of clear night vision, vital for security after
      hours. It is also POE, allowing it to draw power from the network cable when
      used with a compatible switch. This greatly reduces the number of cables you
      have to run."
