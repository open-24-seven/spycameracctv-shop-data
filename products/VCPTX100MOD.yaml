    description: "Veracity is one of the most respected names in IP security, creating
      networking accessories for a wide range of specialist applications. The Outreach
      Max XT is part of their popular range of PoE extenders, letting you boost the
      distance over which cameras can draw power from the network by 100m. Multiple
      units can also be chained together to allow a total transmission distance of
      up to 400m (for 6W cameras).\r\n\r\nCrucially, the extenders are protected by
      a heavy duty IP66 housing. This ensures they are completely weatherproof, and
      suitable for installation in exposed locations. This is essential for setting
      up IP systems across large properties such as farms or car parks."
