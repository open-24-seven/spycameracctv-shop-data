    description: "Hikvision's Turbo HD-TVI range allows a simple plug-and-play installation,
      whilst still providing amazing resolution and subject detail. This compact dome
      camera is no exception, capturing 5 megapixel (2560x1944) images with over twice
      the detail of Full HD. Unlike IP camera systems, there's no configuration required,
      just plug them in using standard RG59 cable and they're ready to use. \r\n\r\nThe
      camera itself is housed inside an IK10 rated vandalproof dome, making it a great
      option to install in high risk, prominent locations. Infra red LEDs provide
      20m of night vision range,and the housing is also IP67 rated weather proof.
      This all means the camera is versatile enough to be used anywhere from the inside
      of a bar to the exterior of a warehouse. \r\n\r\nThe camera also supports Power-over-Coax
      (PoC), letting it draw power from a compatible DVR over the RG59 cable, and
      removing the need for an additional power supply."
