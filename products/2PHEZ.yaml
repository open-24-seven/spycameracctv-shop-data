    description: "This Wireless Covert Home Security System combines two of our tiny
      Pinhole Cameras with an advanced hybrid CCTV DVR. This means there is now no
      need to choose between the discretion of Spy Cameras and the in depth monitoring
      options provided by a dedicated Recorder- this system combines the two! This
      makes it ideal for Security in the home or office.\r\n\r\nThe included cameras
      are tiny, measuring approximately 2x2x2cm- install them behind books on a shelf,
      or hidden inside a desk drawer. The cameras use a miniature pinhole lens, allowing
      them to record video through gaps as narrow as 2mm! This lets you place the
      cameras neatly out of sight, with only the inconspicuous black lens on show.
      As the devices are so light, we have even had customers mount them on a wall
      with blue-tac!\r\n\r\nCrucially, these are Wireless CCTV Cameras, allowing them
      to transmit both video and audio to the included receivers without the need
      for any suspicious trailing AV cables. All the cameras need to start transmitting
      is a connection to a power supply. The built in transmitters have an unobstructed
      Wireless range of 50m, although (as with all similar devices) solid obstructions
      such as walls will reduce this significantly. This makes the kit ideal for home
      security, as the cameras can be installed downstairs in the hallway or near
      an entrance, whilst the recorder remains out of the way upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe
      included Hikvision Easy TVI Digital Video Recorder is capable of handling 4
      channels of video. It allows you to expand the system with up to 2 additional
      cameras at a later date. This device can be easily connected to almost any TV
      or computer monitor, allowing live viewing from the cameras. Alternatively,
      just set the DVR to record, and you can leave it tucked away as a standalone
      device, storing up to 2 weeks worth of continuous footage on the integrated
      Hard Drive. You can choose your choice of storage from the drop down menu at
      the top of the page.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our professional CCTV DVRs, this
      recorder features a <strong>Motion Detection</strong> mode, allowing it to trigger
      whenever it senses movement in one of the video channels. This can be further
      fine tuned with sensitivity adjustment and zone masking.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
      the recorder boasts an ethernet connection, allowing you- following a one time
      set up process- to easily log in and view live footage from your cameras online!
      This even works with mobile devices, so you can keep an eye on your property,
      even when on the move! This system comes with everything you need to set this
      up, and is fairly straightforward if you have knowledge of routers and port
      forwarding. If not then never fear- we have an easy remote <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/remote-accessed-DVR-internet-setup-service\"
      title=\"DVR Set Up Service\">DVR set up service</a> that can get this up and
      running for you and provide 3 months of ongoing support!"
