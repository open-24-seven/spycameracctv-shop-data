    description: "Wireless cameras are a fantastic way to add flexibility to your
      home security system. They can easily be moved to new locations without the
      need for extensive rewiring, making them an excellent choice for security in
      rented properties, or in awkward to reach spots. This compact digital wireless
      CCTV camera also has the benefit of capturing images in 720p HD, or one megapixel,
      significantly more detail than is traditionally possible with wireless devices.\r\n\r\nThis
      increase in quality is possible because the camera uses AHD encoding, allowing
      it to capture HD video efficiently enough to transmit over a wireless signal.
      Luckily, this format of video is compatible with all of our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spy/cctv-recorders/tvi-hd-dvrs/\"
      target=\"_blank\">HD hybrid DVRs</a>, so you can easily integrate this camera
      into an existing security system. The camera transmits to the receiver using
      digital wireless technology, helping greatly reduce the risk of interference
      & picture breakdown, and providing a range of up to 100m in clear line of sight.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera is also fitted with a ring of infrared LEDs, providing 15m of night vision
      range. The metal housing is rated IP66 weather proof, allowing it to be installed
      even in the most exposed outdoor locations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
