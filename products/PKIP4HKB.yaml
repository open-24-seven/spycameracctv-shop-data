    description: "Our Wireless CCTV systems are some of our most popular kits, and
      for good reason: they are perfect for areas where you can't run cables directly
      to a recorder, or for when you might need to move a camera to a different location.
      \r\n\r\nCompared to wired cameras, they do have some limitations: they typically
      can't transmit images of the same resolution, and there is a risk of potential
      wireless interference. However, there is a way around this! This Hikvision WiFi
      camera system uses IP cameras that connect to the recorder directly via WiFi.
      Connecting via WiFi allows the cameras to work at significantly higher resolutions
      than traditional wireless cameras, up to 4 megapixels (2688x1520), or twice
      that of Full HD. It also means you are using an existing wireless signal, rather
      than broadcasting a new one that could be prone to interference. All you would
      need to do, is check if there is decent signal at the location you want to install
      each camera (using a phone is a great way to check this), and that you can reach
      it with the included 12V power cable. The cameras are first plugged into the
      recorder for an initial configuration, and after that connect using WiFi.\r\n\r\nThe
      recorder itself is a professional grade HD model from Hikvision, capable of
      recording full resolution footage from each camera without any loss in quality.
      The kit also includes a pre-installed 1 Terabyte hard drive for storage. \r\n\r\nThe
      network video recorder connects to your router, letting you watch your cameras
      or recordings from anywhere using a PC, phone or tablet. The PC app even lets
      you configure Hikvision's smart detection features, including line crossing,
      object removal and intrusion detection."
