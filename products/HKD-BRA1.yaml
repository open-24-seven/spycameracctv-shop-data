    description: "We always recommend adding a junction box if you are installing
      a Hikvision camera to the exterior of a building. The durable metal bracket
      helps protect the cable connectors from vandals., The housing is rated IP64,
      providing more than enough weather protection for wiring.\r\n\r\nUsing a junction
      box also makes installing the camera significantly easier, as you no longer
      have to drill a large hall in an exterior wall to feed through the ethernet
      connector."
