    description: "Installing a high grade camera such as a TVI HD model, with an additional
      microphone? High grade cables such as RG59 are usually sold \"shotgun\" style,
      with a video and power line, but no connector for audio. Uniquely, this RG59
      cable has an additional RCA connector, letting you run video, audio and power
      all in one device.\r\n\r\nWe also have these cables in 5m, 10m, 30m, 40m, 50m
      and 60m lengths, so you can be sure to find what you're looking for"
