    description: "The Wifi bridge is a powerful but cost effective way to set up IP
      cameras- and many other network devices- over an incredibly long range via wireless.
      With a clear line of sight between the two devices you can get up to 5km range!
      This makes it perfectly suited for use on farms and remote properties, where
      running a cable is simply not an option.\r\n\r\nThe two devices work by creating
      a \"peer to peer\" WiFi link with each other, in effect acting like an invisible
      cable to carry the data. There is an ethernet port on each unit, so you can
      easily plug an IP camera into one, and then connect the corresponding unit to
      your router in another building. You could even connect multiple cameras to
      the unit via a network switch.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
