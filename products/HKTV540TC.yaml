    description: "Hikvision's Turbo HD line of HD-TVI CCTV cameras is one of the most
      popular on the market, providing exceptional picture quality using standard
      coaxial cable.  The result is a high resolution picture with none of the in
      depth configuration or set up needed with IP cameras. This turret camera is
      no exception, capturing 2560x1944 5 megapixel video, using plug-and-play BNC
      connectors.\r\n\r\nAs well as the impressive recording resolution, the camera
      boasts IP67 rated weather protection for installation out in the open. High
      power EXIR illuminators provide 40m night vision, allowing use in large outdoor
      spaces whilst not losing detail for subjects close to the camera. \r\n\r\nThe
      camera uses a standard twist-fit BNC output, so can plug straight in to any
      HD-TVI compatible recorder. It even supports Power-over-Coax (PoC), letting
      it draw power from a compatible DVR over the RG59 cable, and removing the need
      for an additional power supply. "
