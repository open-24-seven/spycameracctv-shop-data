    description: "Hikvision has put together their HiWatch range as a way to bring
      the market-leading image quality and reliability of their professional grade
      CCTV equipment to the home user. Each camera uses much of the same imaging technology
      as the commercial models, but at a fraction of the price and a much simpler
      installation.\r\n\r\nAs part of this range, this 2MP bullet camera boasts video
      recording at 1920x1080p Full HD, capturing plenty of subject detail. Hidden
      behind the front cover of the housing, infrared LEDs provide up to 30m of night
      vision range, more than enough for most large interior spaces and gardens. The
      camera is built into an IP67 rated weatherproof, allowing use in uncovered outdoor
      spots.\r\n\r\nThe camera uses Power-over-Ethernet, drawing power down the cable
      connecting it to your network and removing the need to wire a separate power
      supply. Once connected to your network, you can configure it to be viewed remotely
      from a PC, phone or tablet using free apps. The control software lets you record
      footage and even set up motion detection recording to your PC, or alternatively
      connect the camera to an <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spy/cctv-recorders/hd-ip-nvrs/\"
      target=\"_blank\">NVR</a> for extended recording. \r\n\r\n"
