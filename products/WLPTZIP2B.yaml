    description: "Our range of livestock camera kits have all been purpose-designed
      to help you monitor animals from across large farm properties. This unique wireless
      calving camera kit goes one step further, providing remote control over the
      camera's movements directly from your phone. This makes it perfect for monitoring
      animals inside of a large shed or barn, where they might be moving around, or
      in different locations.\r\n\r\nThis is all possible thanks to the included pan
      tilt zoom (or \"PTZ\") IP camera. This is mounted to a motorised base, allowing
      it to be rotated up, down and side to side by the user. It features a built-in
      10x optical zoom that can be controlled using the same interface. To ensure
      it can be used 24/7, the camera also boasts a huge 100m night vision range.
      This means it is suitable for even the largest farm buildings. In case you want
      to mount it outdoors then it is rated IP66 for complete weatherproofing. Without
      the need for several cameras calving season can be made less stressful.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera connects to your home's internet router using a pair of powerful wifi
      transmitters that can be mounted on the barn and your farmhouse. With a direct
      line of sight, they allow transmission up to an incredible 3km range. Once configured
      to your network, the camera can be viewed and controlled using a PC or mobile
      device. If you want even more precise control of the camera movements, we also
      offer a joystick controller. This allows intuitive, fingertip control, as well
      as the ability to program in preset movements. You can add this from the drop-down
      menu at the top of the page.\r\n\r\nSome knowledge of networking is generally
      advised for configuring the camera, however, we also offer a remote setup service
      if you would prefer us to take care of that side of things. Just check the menu
      at the top of the page for more information."
