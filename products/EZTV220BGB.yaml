    description: "Hikvision's popular HiWatch range provides the pin-sharp and reliable
      image quality of their professional security cameras, but with a price tag that
      makes them ideal for home users. This compact bullet camera is a great option
      for watching over a small garden or alleyway.\r\n\r\nThe camera can capture
      footage in 1080p Full HD, recording the fine details needed for video to be
      usable as evidence. The cameras are pre-set to record in the HD-TVI format,
      so they can easily work with our CCTV DVRs. They use 4-in-1 technology however,
      ensuring they are cross compatible with almost every CCTV system that uses coaxial
      cables - a huge bonus if you're upgrading an existing system.\r\n\r\nFor after
      dark, the camera uses a ring of infra-red LEDs to provide 20m of night vision
      illumination. The camera housing is rated IP66 weatherproof, so you can use
      it both indoors and outdoors without concern."
