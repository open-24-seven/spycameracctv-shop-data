    description: "This simple to use USB Video Capture device is a fantastic way to
      digitise any analogue video, ideal for combining one of our Bird Box Cameras
      or Pinhole Cameras with an Apple Mac Computer. Unlike other similar devices
      on the market, this one is purpose built for use with Macs (<i>and Macs only!</i>)\r\n\r\nSimply
      hook your camera up to the RCA phono cables, and run the included software to
      start recording. The device features stereo audio inputs to capture high quality
      sound as well. We stock these as the perfect accessory for our range of Spy
      Cameras and Wireless Cameras, but don't let that limit you! This works with
      any RCA or S-Video feed, so can be used to record console games, or digitise
      old home videos- anything with an AV output."
