    description: "As security technology gets smaller and more powerful, it's becoming
      expected that taxi and minibus operators will protect their drivers & passengers
      with CCTV. In fact, it's now a requirement under many local authorities. In
      car CCTV not only helps deter incidents or abuse, but can also help prevent
      fraudulent claims by providing an objective record of journeys. Our Taxi CCTV
      system features two cameras with 1080p Full HD recording, as well as a PoE switch
      to power them from the battery.\r\n\r\nThe system uses Hikvision mini dome cameras
      - the workhorse brand of the security industry, renowned for exceptional reliability
      and picture quality. Each camera boasts night vision LEDs as well as low light
      sensitivity, ensuring a clear picture even in larger unlit vehicles. The compact
      domes are also rated IK08 vandal proof, providing protection from damage. Footage
      is recorded to onboard MicroSD card slots, so you don't need to connect a separate
      recorder.\r\n\r\nBother cameras are powered by a Veracity CamSwitch - a PoE
      device that is wired directly to the vehicle's battery, outputting 12V down
      standard ethernet cables. When the system is first installed it requires an
      initial configuration with a laptop, but will then remember settings and record
      on a rolling basis when the engine is running.  "
