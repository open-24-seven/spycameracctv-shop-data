    description: This 30m Cat 5e ethernet cable is designed specifically for use with
      demanding, high bandwidth network applications such as HD IP camera systems
      and NVRs. The cable itself is waterproof, allowing it to be used in permanent
      outdoor installations. By clipping the connectors off, you can even use it as
      a PTZ data cable.
