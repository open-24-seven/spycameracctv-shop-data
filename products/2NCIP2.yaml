    description: "Our Green Feathers line of HD wildlife cameras is the culmination
      of years of experience selling and designing bespoke CCTV systems for bird boxes,
      nesting houses and breeders. This aviary camera kit uses two of these specialist
      devices, along with a network video recorder and all of the cabling required
      to get it up and running. It's a complete solution for monitoring your birds
      in a large cage, small aviary or pigeon loft, and lets you check up on them
      wherever you are using a PC, phone or tablet.\r\n\r\nThe cameras are small enough
      to be installed in the corner of the cage, and use a 2.8mm lens to record everything
      in a 103 degree field of view. Despite their size, they record pin sharp 1080p
      HD video, recording far more detail than other dedicated cameras on the market.
      Footage is recorded in vivid true-to-life colour during day, whilst invisible
      IR LEDs provide clear night vision after dark, with no red glow to disturb the
      birds. They even have microphones to record audio from inside the aviary.\r\n\r\nAlso
      included in the kit is 20m of cabling per camera, and a network video recorder
      to connect them to. The NVR uses power-over-ethernet to send power to the cameras,
      so you don't need to run separate power supplies into the cage. By connecting
      the NVR to your network you can set up remote access, letting you log in with
      an app to view your birds from anywhere with an internet connection. If you
      have knowledge of RTSP streams, then you can even set up streaming to websites.
      Add a hard drive to the NVR to allow recording of weeks' of footage at a time."
