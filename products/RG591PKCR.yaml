    description: "This little kit includes all of the fittings and connectors required
      to fit one camera to a length of our professional uncut RG59 cable reels. Our
      high copper cabling is vital for systems that use high grade CCTV cameras such
      as Sony's EFFIO range. The bundle features 2 BNC crimp connectors and 1 male
      & 1 female DC power plugs.\r\n\r\nBNC crimp connectors provide a durable and
      long-lasting end to your cable, but you do need access to a crimping tool in
      order to fit them."
