      style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, itâ€™s also important to consider the size of
      the houseâ€™s entrance hole; it plays a huge part in a birdâ€™s decision to
      make a home there or not. \r\n\r\nWe can categorise different birds of a feather,
      each group with a specific preference for their own little hobbit door size:\r\n<div
      class=\"bullets\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Small birds</strong> such as <strong>blue</strong>,
      <strong>coal</strong>, and <strong>marsh tits</strong>: <strong>25</strong>mm</li>\r\n<li><strong>Great
      tits</strong> and <strong>tree sparrows</strong>: <strong>28</strong>mm</li>\r\n<li><strong>Large
      variety</strong> including <strong>house sparrows</strong>, <strong>nuthatches</strong>,
      and <strong>woodpeckers</strong>: <strong>32</strong>mm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\nIf
      you have your heart set on housing and protecting a specific feathered family,
      order this matching 32mm entrance plate now, so the home is ready to go before
      new baby mamas arrive. \r\n"
