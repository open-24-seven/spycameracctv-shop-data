    description: "Providing outstanding resolution from a discreet, vandalproof housing,
      this Hikvision Turbo HD dome camera is a fantastic option for everything from
      shops to clubs and bars. And what's more it's great value for money, costing
      significantly less than an equivalent IP camera, without sacrificing picture
      quality.\r\n\r\nThe camera records in 1920x1080 Full HD - or 2 megapixels -
      capturing full colour images packed with usable subject detail. The camera also
      uses technology from Hikvision's specialist low light Darkfighter range, allowing
      it to record right down to 0.005 lux without needing night vision. This means
      you can record in colour for longer throughout the day. When night vision is
      needed, two EXIR illuminators provide 20m range.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Turbo-HD
      range, the camera uses HD-TVI technology to send high resolution video down
      a standard BNC cable. This means it's plug-and-play, with no complex configuration
      required to get it running on your recorder. It even uses power-over-coax (POC),
      letting it draw power from a compatible DVR over the RG59 cable, and removing
      the need for an additional power supply (requires compatible DVR)."
