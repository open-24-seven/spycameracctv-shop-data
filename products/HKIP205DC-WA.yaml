    description: "It's an all too familiar problem - you wait days for a delivery,
      only for it to finally arrive when you're at work, leaving you with the dreaded
      card on your doormat. Hikvision's wifi doorbell camera provides an easy solution,
      letting you talk to people at your door remotely, using your mobile phone. It's
      also an ideal way to help keep your home secure, making sure you always know
      who's at your door, no matter where you are. \r\n\r\nThe camera is installed
      in much the same way as a traditional doorbell, using screw terminals for power.
      The integrated camera uses some of the same technology as Hikvision's professional
      CCTV cameras, capturing 1080p (2 megapixel) video packed with detail. The device
      also features an ultra wide angle lens to get everything in the frame, and non-glow
      infrared LEDs with a 5m range to ensure a great picture at all hours. The kit
      even includes 4 different faceplates, which can be easily switched to best match
      your home's colours.\r\n\r\nFollowing a simple configuration process, the camera
      connects to your home Wifi network. You can then use Hikvision's popular Hik-Connect
      app to view the camera on your mobile, wherever you are. As well as checking
      live footage and alerts when the bell is pressed, you can also set motion detection
      notifications for any subject in front of your door.  The app also features
      two way audio, letting you talk to callers via the built-in speaker."
