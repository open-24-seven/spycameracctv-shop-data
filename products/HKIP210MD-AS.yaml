    description: "Planning a security system for a shop or bar can be frustrating,
      as you need to ensure you can record with enough detail to keep your staff and
      customers secure. At the same time, many of the commercial grade cameras on
      the market are bulky and obtrusive. This mini dome IP camera from Hikvision
      is the perfect solution, packing a 3MP high resolution sensor into a tiny, discreet
      dome housing. The small size and inconspicuous design make it ideal for retail
      spaces and venues.\r\n\r\nFootage is recorded in 1920x1080p Full HD (or 2 Megapixel),
      capturing substantially more subject detail than Full HD. The imaging sensor
      can work in conditions as dark as 0.009 lux in full colour, or can use the built-in
      IR LEDs for 10m night vision in totally unlit conditions. Despite its size,
      the dome is also rated IK08 vandalproof, so it can be mounted on a low ceiling
      or above a doorway without risk of being damaged. It's even rated IP66 waterproof,
      allowing outdoor use. The camera even has a tiny built in microphone, to capture
      audio from nearby subjects.\r\n\r\nThe IP camera connects to your network, supporting
      Power-over-ethernet. Once configured, you can view live or recorded footage
      from anywhere, using a PC or mobile device. The camera's processor allows the
      use of a range of smart detection features, including line crossing, intrusion,
      and object removal detection, helping you automate your system's coverage. There
      is also a built-in MicroSD card slot that can be used to record footage, or
      even act as a back up in case the connection to your recorder is lost (card
      not included). "
