    description: "This professional grade turret IP camera from Hikvision uses the
      latest technology to record high resolution video at 4 megapixel resolution.
      The end result is a camera that captures over twice the detail of even 1080p
      Full HD rivals, and recording evidence packed with usable detail. This makes
      the camera a fantastic choice for everything from retail or office applications,
      or venue security in bars & clubs.\r\n\r\nHikvision's advanced IP cameras now
      feature behavioural analytics as standard, providing a wide range of ways to
      automate recording and alerts that can all be set using Hikvision's PC app or
      a recorder. These include triggering alerts when a subject crosses a predetermined
      line or box onscreen, when objects are removed, and many more. This all provides
      extra flexibility when setting up your security system, and helps ensure you
      only have to review the important parts of the video. \r\n\r\nThe camera is
      housed inside of a compact turret casing, protecting it from the elements and
      dust, and allowing use in exposed outdoor locations. It's also kitted out with
      30m of night vision range. This helps keep a crisp and well defined picture
      even in completely unlit rooms, or a large garden. A built-in MicroSD card slot
      lets you use it as a standalone device without needing an external recorder."
