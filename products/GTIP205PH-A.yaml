    description: "Designed for the most demanding covert security situations, this
      pinhole spy camera is one of the very smallest IP Full HD pinhole spy cameras
      available on the market today. This makes it the camera to go for if you need
      the most compact camera possible for concealment, without compromising on capturing
      the best possible video images. It can be used in situations as varied as office
      security, watching over a till, or keeping an eye on the safe.\r\n\r\nAlmost
      all professional grade IP security cameras are unwieldy beasts, perfect for
      setting up on an exterior wall, but totally unusable for discreet security.
      Despite using a fully fledged HD sensor, this camera is equipped with cooling
      fins, allowing it to be housed in a much smaller casing. Whilst not quite as
      small as the smallest analogue CCTV cameras, it allows you to finally use advanced
      IP technology for covert security. The pinhole lens is designed to record through
      tiny gaps, allowing the body of the camera to remain concealed in a drawer or
      behind a wall.\r\n\r\nAs with all IP cameras, this small device records great
      detail, capturing 1920x1080p full HD video- or approximately 2 megapixels. The
      camera plugs directly into a router or switch to connect to your network, allowing
      you to view live footage on a PC using the included software. The program even
      allows you to set up basic recording options, including motion detection and
      scheduling. There is also a standard BNC video output, letting you plug it into
      a TV for quick monitoring. For longer term recording however, we always recommend
      using one of our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spy/hd-ip-cameras/hd-nvrs/\"
