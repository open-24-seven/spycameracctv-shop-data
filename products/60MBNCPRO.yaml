    description: "Just invested in one of our TVI Professional HD Cameras? The last
      thing you want is for your camera's exceptional performance to be compromised
      by sub-standard cabling. The solution is our range of professional quality CCTV
      video and power cables, all composed of high grade Copper RG59 wire. This provides
      much lower signal drop-off than with a standard cable, ensuring no loss of image
      quality.\r\n\r\nThis 2 way CCTV cable also features a DC power line fitted with
      a standard 2.1mm power jack. This means you only have to run one cable out to
      your cameras, rather than two. \r\n\r\nLooking for a shorter cable? We stock
      these in 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 metre lengths, and can even supply 100m and
      250m uncut reels! If you have any questions, or need help setting up your system,
      just give our technical advisers a call- just see our contact page for the easiest
      way to get in touch!"
