    description: "This compact digital wireless video and audio transmitter/receiver
      pair is ideal for sending your CCTV camera's feed over a long distance without
      the requirement of vast lengths of cable. The kit is compatible with any CCTV
      camera and DVR that uses a BNC connection for video and a RCA/phono connection
      for audio. Digital wireless transmission allows the small sender to transmit
      video and audio over a range of up to 100 metres in clear line-of-sight without
      interference. In short, it can turn any standard CCTV camera into a wireless
      camera.\r\n\r\nSimple and secure set up is provided by pairing. With just a
      push of a button the transmitter and receiver are securely paired to prevent
      any other device receiving the camera's feed.\r\n\r\nTo boost the range of the
      digital wireless transmitter why not attach one of our 7dB antennas?"
