    description: "1080p security systems are fantastic for many applications, but
      even 2MP cameras sometimes don't provide enough resolution, such as when you
      need to make out specific faces from a distance away, or need to track movement
      in crowds. For these high end commercial security applications, 4K CCTV really
      comes into it's own. This Hikvision 4K bullet IP camera is a great example,
      recording at an immense resolution, and packing a massive range of advanced
      features.\r\n\r\n4K video is recorded at 3840x2160 resolution, providing 4 times
      the detail of even the best 1080p cameras. In order to get the best coverage
      it is fitted with a 4mm wide angle lens with a 79Â° field of view. Powerful
      IR LEDs also provide 50m night vision range, making sure you still get plenty
      of detail even after dark. The camera is also built into an IP67 rated outdoor
      housing, allowing use throughout even the most challenging weather conditions.\r\n\r\nIP
      camera technology means the camera records digital video, then sends it down
      a network cable directly to your router. You can then view live over a PC or
      mobile device, or record footage to an NVR connected to the same network. The
      camera even features a MicroSD card slot, letting you record short sections
      of footage directly without needing a separate recorder. Advanced image processing
      technology also allows analytics features such as detecting specific faces,
      or triggering recording when a subject crosses a preset boundary."
