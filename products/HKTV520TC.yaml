    description: "Hikvision's Turbo HD-TVI range is one of our most popular lines
      of security cameras, providing amazing picture quality down a simple coaxial
      cable. The result is a plug-and-play HD system that doesn't need the configuration
      or setup of an IP camera. This compact turret camera is part of the latest generation
      of HD-TVI cameras, recording at a ridiculous <i>5 megapixel</i> resolution.
      That means 2592x1944 videos, significantly higher than anything outside of the
      most advanced IP cameras.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not just the resolution that's impressive
      - the camera packs this sensor into a compact & discreet turret style housing
      ideal for retail or venue security. The housing is IP67 rated and fully weatherproof,
      allowing it to be installed indoors or outdoors. It also has 20m night vision
      range, thanks to Hikvision's advanced EXIR infrared LEDs, ensuring even lighting
      across the image.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe camera uses a standard twist-fit BNC output,
      so can plug straight in to any HD-TVI compatible recorder. It even supports
      Power-over-Coax (PoC), letting it draw power from a compatible DVR over the
      RG59 cable, and removing the need for an additional power supply. "
