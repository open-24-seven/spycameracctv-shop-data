    description: "We are often contacted by customers who want to set up their own
      home security system, but are put off by the prospect of connecting everything
      together. This wireless security camera system is the perfect solution, with
      4 wireless cameras sending video back to one central device that acts are receiver,
      recorder and monitor. This makes it so much simpler to install, meaning it's
      a fantastic option for DIY users. Don't let that fool you, though- it's also
      one of the most feature packed kits in our entire range!\r\n\r\nThe system features
      4 bullet cameras, each housed in an IP66 rated weatherproof casing. This makes
      them suitable for use indoors or outdoors. A ring of IR LEDs provides clear
      night vision for subjects up to 10m away. Uniquely, they also feature PIR sensors.
      These can detect changes in temperature caused by a subject moving, and use
      this to trigger recording for more accurately than standard motion detection.\r\n\r\nThe
      cameras connect to the recorder using digital wireless transmission. This helps
      keep the signal free from interference and picture breakdown. It also allows
      the cameras to transmit to the receiver from up to 100m away in direct line
      of sight, although this will be reduced with obstructions. <i>Please note, as
      with all wireless CCTV, the cameras will still need to be connected to a power
      source</i>.\r\n\r\nThe recorder itself features a built-in 9\" colour monitor,
      so you don't need to connect it to a separate TV to view your cameras. It records
      to MicroSD cards up to 128GB in size (not included), allowing you to easily
      store and share footage. The device even features a rechargeable battery, allowing
      you to use it unplugged for short periods of time. The system can also be plugged
      in to your router, letting you watch the cameras live on an iPhone or Android
      handset."
