      All products have had some use, some pay have cosmetic damage, such as screw
      fixings damage.\r\n\r\nThis simple to use USB Video Capture device is a fantastic
      way to digitise any analogue video, ideal for combining one of our Bird Box
      Cameras or Pinhole Cameras with an Apple Mac Computer. Unlike other similar
      devices on the market, this one is purpose built for use with Macs (<i>and Macs
      only!</i>)\r\n\r\nSimply hook your camera up to the RCA phono cables, and run
      the included software to start recording. The device features stereo audio inputs
      to capture high quality sound as well. We stock these as the perfect accessory
      for our range of Spy Cameras and Wireless Cameras, but don't let that limit
      you! This works with any RCA or S-Video feed, so can be used to record console
      games, or digitise old home videos- anything with an AV output!"
