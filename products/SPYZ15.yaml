    description: "Thanks to its integrated <strong>rechargeable battery</strong>,
      this covert mini spy camera recorder is one of our most versatile devices for
      covert recording! The battery means it can be used extensively without a single
      trailing wire or cable that could otherwise attract attention. This flexibility,
      coupled with its incredibly small size and light weight make it an ideal choice
      for a wide array of covert applications!\r\n\r\nCentral to this camera's usability,
      is its extensive list of recording triggering modes, allowing it to be tailored
      to a wide variety of situations. These include <strong>vibration triggering</strong>
      using a built-in g-meter. This will start recording as soon as it detects a
      shockwave nearby, making it ideal for dashboard recording in a car. <strong>Voice
      triggering</strong> is perfect for covertly recording meetings or discussions*.
      Finally, <strong>motion triggering</strong> allows the recorder to be used as
      a security camera, initiating recording as soon as it detects movement in the
      frame.\r\n\r\nThese recording options are especially powerful when combined
      with the device's impressive battery life. The internal battery is capable of
      recording continuously for up to 10 hours non stop, and when used with vibration
      triggering can remain on standby for an incredible 4 months! This gives you
      the freedom to leave it in remote locations with no power source, or for long
      periods of time in spots that prevent cables, like in a desk drawer.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera records crisp High Definition footage straight to a Micro SD card slot,
      allowing easy storage and transfer for your videos. The device works with cards
      up to 128GB in capacity, equivalent to 64 hours of footage with the higher quality
      settings, or an astounding 128 hours with a reduced frame rate! If the card
      does fill up, then the circular recording option can automatically begin to
      record over older footage, meaning you only have to use the device when you
      want to check for suspicious incidents!\r\n\r\n<i>Please note, some settings
      must be activated using Zetta software with the camera connected to the computer.
      Please consult the quickstart guide for more information.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>*Always
      consult with local police before covertly recording discussions, as regulations
      may vary.</i>"
