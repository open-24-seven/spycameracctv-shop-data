    description: "Power-over-ethernet IP cameras draw power down the network cable,
      so they don't need a second cable to connect to mains. Usually this requires
      a PoE compatible switch or recorder, but this PoE Injector is a fantastic solution
      if this is not possible. It connects to mains, and sends power up to 100m down
      Cat6 or Cat5e cable to provide power to a camera.\r\n\r\nThe injector uses 48V
      \"active\" PoE, so you don't need a splitter at the camera end. Please note
      injector is not compatible with PoE+, or higher voltage protocols."
