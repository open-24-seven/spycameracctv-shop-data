    description: "Looking for a professional quality security camera for monitoring
      a office, shop or house? This camera, when attached to the wall, will covertly
      record video without anyone noticing. Hiding a HD spy camera within a casing
      of a PIR sensor, the camera captures footage through a tiny pinhole on the front
      of the casing unbeknown to the unexpecting eye. When installed on the corner
      of a hallway or stockroom it looks like any other PIR sensor but this one enables
      you to monitor the room in 1080p HD.\r\n\r\nThis covert camera features TVI
      HD technology a cutting-edge surveillance video format that was previously only
      available in large, bulky security cameras. This allows you to capture clear
      video full of usable detail, whilst still keeping your security system discreet.
      What's more, TVI video uses standard BNC connectors so if you have an existing
      system then you can potentially use the same coaxial cabling.\r\n\r\nTo record
      footage just hook up the camera, using your coaxial cabling, to your TVI HD
      DVR recorder and enjoy high quality recorded footage for playback at a later
      date. This device can also be set to work with traditional analogue recorders
      and AHD."
