    description: "This pair of <strong>CCTV Video Baluns</strong> provide a quick
      and easy way of transmitting video from your CCTV system over a standard Cat5
      cable. This type of cable is common in many offices and workplaces, so these
      adapters potentially provide a way of reducing the amount of cabling you will
      have to install.\r\n\r\nTo use them, simply strip two lengths of wire from each
      end of your Cat5 cable- be sure to use the same colour wires at each end- and
      insert them into the Balun's terminals. You cna now plug the cable straight
      into your Recorder or camera with the standard BNC connector.\r\n\r\nUsing these
      Baluns will allow you to potentially send video over much greater distances-
      up to 300m!"
