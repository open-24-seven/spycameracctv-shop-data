    description: "This door peephole spy camera is ideal for those looking for some
      added security in their home or even business. If you want to see who is at
      the front door without opening it or even leaving the comfort of your living
      room then this may be the peephole camera for you. The camera lens is discrete
      at just the size of a 2p, so visitors to your front door will assume it's just
      a standard peephole. \r\n\r\nThe lens itself is a wide-angle to give you the
      best view possible of your front door despite its tiny size. It has a low lux
      rating giving you a good picture when it's dark. Simply drill a hole in your
      front door (or any surface) and secure the lens. The lens is waterproof to withstand
      any wet weather it may come face to face with. \r\n\r\nThis set comes with a
      connection to view the footage from your TV, you can also add a DVR to your
      kit to record your footage rather than just view it live. "
