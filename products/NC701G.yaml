    description: "Measuring just 42 x 35 x 35mm, this small wireless bird box camera
      screws neatly inside a nest box without disturbing the birds nesting inside.
      The camera can connect wirelessly to the receiver which can be connected to
      a TV or a recorder up to 50m away (significantly reduced when going through
      obstructions such as walls or thick bushes) making it convenient for you to
      enjoy the nesting birds from the comfort of your home. \r\n\r\nThe camera may
      be small, but it boasts some impressive features including 700TVL high image
      quality so you can see every feather, much more detail than most nest box cameras
      available on the market. This bird box camera offers focus from just a few inches
      away up to 10 meters, enabling you to get the best pictures no matter how far
      the bird is away from the lens. The lens is a wide angle 2.8mm lens to give
      you full coverage of inside the nest box so you can see the entrance hole and
      the bottom of the bird box. This way you won't miss any of the eggciting action
      as your garden birds go about their business. \r\n\r\nThe 6 LEDs are just right
      for seeing in a small space in dark conditions and they are not too powerful
      to burn themselves out of disturb the birds. This way you get 24/7 footage of
      your nesting birds, and if you use a recorder you can play your footage back
      at a later time. \r\n\r\nThis wireless bird box camera is available in 1 of
      4 channels so you can add more cameras to your system at a later date as you
      add more nest boxes to your garden. Chances are you'll swiftly be adding more
      cameras once you get hooked on having your very own Springwatch at home. \r\n\r\nPlease
      note:\r\n- Does not come with a microphone/audio option\r\n- This camera boasts
      wireless connection and offers the option of a rechargeable battery (up to 20
      hours recording time), but generally does use a cable to connect to the mains
      for power supply.  "
