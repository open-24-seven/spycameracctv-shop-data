    description: "Wireless CCTV cameras are a great option if you are looking for
      a simple DIY installation, as all you need to do is plug them into a power supply.
      Often however, you have to compromise on a recorder to go with them. Not so
      with this system! For this digital wireless security system we have combined
      long range wireless CCTV cameras with a professional grade DVR. This provides
      both a quick installation and in depth recording options, perfect for home security.\r\n\r\nThis
      kit features 2 bullet cameras that are housed in IP66 rated waterproof casings,
      making them suitable for indoor or outdoor use. When used in unlit areas, they
      can still record clearly thanks to night vision LEDs that provide a range of
      up to 15 metres. Thanks to digital wireless transmission technology they send
      VGA resolution video to the receiver from up to 100m away (in direct line-of-sight).
      Digital wireless also helps keep interference and picture breakdown to a minimum.
      \r\n\r\nThe 2 cameras are picked up by the dual receiver, which then plug straight
      into the professional CCTV DVR, fitted with your choice of hard drive. The recorder
      is loaded with a complete suite of in-depth recording settings including motion
      detection and a 7-day schedule. Other features include HDMI output as well as
      PTZ and alarm inputs. The recorder also features a network connection via which
      you can connect to your network router. Once configured, this allows you to
      log in to view live and recorded footage remotely using a PC or mobile device.
      As an added bonus the recorder is a hybrid HD model so if you upgrade to 1080p
      cameras at a later date it will be compatible."
