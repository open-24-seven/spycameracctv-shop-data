    description: Using a junction box is usually the best way to install a CCTV camera
      on the exterior of a building. All of the cabling running from the camera can
      be connected inside the IP65 rated metal box, protecting it from weather, and
      from vandals. It also makes it so much easier to run the cables through an exterior
      wall, as you don\'t need to drill holes wide enough to fit the bulky pigtail
      cables on the camera.
