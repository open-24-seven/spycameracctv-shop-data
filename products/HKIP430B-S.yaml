    description: "Hikvision's latest range of professional IP security cameras record
      video at 4 megapixel resolution, capturing over twice the subject detail of
      even 1080p Full HD. This, along with their robust build quality and advanced
      automation software, has made Hikvision the go-to workhorse for tradesmen and
      installers across the CCTV industry.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its huge recording
      resolution, this compact bullet camera features 30m night vision to allow 24/7
      monitoring even in unlit large rooms or gardens. The camera is built into an
      IP67 rated weatherproof housing, meaning you can install it indoors or outdoors.
      A Power-over-Ethernet connection lets the camera draw power directly from the
      network cable, helping keep installation and wiring simple. It even features
      a built-in MicroSD card slot, allowing you to record footage without an external
      device.\r\n\r\nThe camera connects to your network via a router or switch. Using
      Hikvision's simple remote access software, you can then view live or recorded
      footage remotely via a PC or mobile device. The camera boasts Hikvision's advanced
      video analytics features, with settings including line crossing and intrusion
      detection. These can be configured with the PC app, letting you automate your
      security system with incredible flexibility.\r\n\r\n"
