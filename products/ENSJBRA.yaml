    description: "Wifi bridges are an effective way to send IP camera signals over
      huge distances, but they do have one slight drawback - they need a direct, unobstructed
      line of sight in order to work. This J bracket is an easy solution, providing
      a simple way of raising the wifi bridge above and away from buildings. \r\n\r\nThe
      bracket is the right size to fit the mountings included with our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/engenius-els500-5ghz-long-range-wifi-bridge-pair-ip-cameras\"
      target=\"_blank\">wifi bridge pair</a>. It also includes the wall mounting kit,
      so you can easily attach it to any exterior wall."
