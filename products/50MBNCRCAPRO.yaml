    description: "Installing a high grade camera such as a TVI HD model, with an additional
      microphone? High grade cables such as RG59 are usually sold \"shotgun\" style,
      with a video and power line, but no connector for audio. Uniquely, this professional
      quality RG59 cable has an additional RCA connector, letting you run video, audio
      and power all in one device.\r\n\r\nWe also have these cables in 5m, 10m, 20m,
      30m, 40m and 60m lengths, so you can be sure to find what you're looking for"
