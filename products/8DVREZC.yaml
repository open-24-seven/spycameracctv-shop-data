    description: "Hikvision's HiWatch range of CCTV DVRs are designed from the ground
      up for simple home security, combining many of the adjustable features from
      their professional recorders with a compact size and a wallet-friendly price
      tag. This 8 channel recorder records high definition video and high-quality
      audio, with enough inputs to secure a large residential property.\r\n\r\nThe
      recorder's 4-in-1 technology is compatible with our HD-TVI (aka \"Turbo HD\")
      CCTV cameras, as well as AHD, CVI and CVBS video formats. Simply put, this means
      that it can record footage from pretty much anything that uses a coaxial cable
      or BNC connector. At can record footage from each camera at up to 1080 lite
      resolution, or can use a long transmission mode, which drops recording down
      to 720p in exchange for the ability to use cables up to 1200m in length. Furthermore,
      the recorder features two IP inputs to allow you to add IP cameras to the recorder.\r\n\r\nThe
      DVR can use H.264+ encoding with compatible cameras, helping to extend recording
      times and save space. You can easily view your cameras on a local TV or monitor
      using VGA or HDMI outputs. Alternatively, connect it to your internet router
      to allow remote access. Once configured, this lets you view live or recorded
      footage from anywhere via a PC, mobile or tablet."
