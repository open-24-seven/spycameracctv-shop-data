    description: "Don't let this camera's compact size fool you - it packs a serious
      punch! This IP security camera is part of Hikvision's Darkfighter range, able
      to record in ultra low light levels without needing infrared. This means it
      can keep recording in colour even down to 0.005 lux - equivalent to moonlight.
      All this is done in 1080p Full HD resolution, recording videos packed with usable
      details, and making it perfect for indoor security in unlit rooms.\r\n\r\nAs
      part of Hikvision's range of professional IP cameras, it also features their
      latest behavioural analytics settings. Set using the PC app or via a compatible
      recorder, they let you automate the camera's recording with extreme precision.
      Options include triggering recording when a preset line is crossed in the image,
      when objects are removed, when subjects enter an area, and even when it recognises
      faces.\r\n\r\nOther advanced security features include an IP67 rated weatherproof
      housing to protect the camera, and 30m night vision range for situations when
      it's too dark even for the low light sensor. The camera uses Power-over-Ethernet
      to draw power down the network cable, so you don't need to set up any separate
      power supplies. It even features an on-board MicroSD card slot, letting you
      use the camera as a standalone recording device."
