    description: "Long a byword for quality and reliability, Hikvision's new range
      of 5 Megapixel IP security cameras record video with over twice the amount of
      subject details as even Full HD. Coupled with their state of the art analytics
      features, this makes them ideally suited to demanding professional applications
      such as  retail or bar & venue security.\r\n\r\nThis bullet camera is a great
      example, packing in a powerful 50m of night vision range for use in large unlit
      spaces. The camera is built into an IP67 rated weatherproof housing, allowing
      installation either indoors or outdoors in the wind and rain. It also features
      a built-in MicroSD card slot, allowing the camera to record clips of video without
      an external recorder. The camera works with Power-over-Ethernet, letting it
      draw power from the network cable instead of requiring a separate power supply.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera connects to your network via a router, switch or recorder, allowing you
      t watch live or recorded footage from anywhere using a PC or mobile app. Hikvision's
      behavioural analytics features provide a huge range of options for automating
      recording and triggering notifications. These include intrusion detection and
      line crossing."
