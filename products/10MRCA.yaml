    description: "These pre-made made cable lengths enable you to easily connect your
      CCTV camera's, recorders, monitors, DVR's etc. together. The Audio and Video
      plugs are standard RCA connections for an excellent snug connection to your
      CCTV cameras and/or recorder. If you have BNC connectors on your cameras, you
      will require a BNC connector, also available from SpyCameraCCTV.com\r\n\r\nThe
      power comes with male to female 2.1mm x 5.5mm DC coaxial connector which will
      suit 99% of standard CCTV cameras as an industry standard connection. \r\n\r\nWe
      can supply several lengths of cable from 5m, 10m, 20m, 30m, 40m and 50m. Specialist
      lengths available on request.\r\n\r\nThese are very flexible cables, exceptional
      in delivering low loss signals over even the very longest cable runs and because
      they carry the video, audio and the power, you only need to run 1 cable for
      your CCTV equipment."
