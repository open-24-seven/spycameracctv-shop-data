    description: "If you've invested in professional CCTV cameras such as our Hikvision
      TurboHD line, then the last thing you want is poor quality cabling compromising
      your gear's performance! For this reason, we have put together this range of
      high grade CCTV Video and Power cables, using Bare copper RG59 wiring. This
      helps minimise the signal drop-off that can cause a notable drop in image quality
      in lower grade wiring.\r\n\r\nThis 2 way Coaxial cable not only features a Video
      wire, but also a DC power line with standard 2.1mm jack. This means you can
      run both video and power to your camera with ONE cable, and really saves time
      when installing your system!\r\n\r\nLooking for a different length of cable?
      We stock these in 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 metre lengths, and can even supply
      massive uncut reels! If you have any questions, or need help setting up your
      system, just give our technical advisers a call- just see our contact page for
      the easiest way to get in touch!"
