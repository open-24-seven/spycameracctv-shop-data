      return or an ex-display model that is in a good condition but may have some
      light cosmetic damage.\r\n\r\nThis rugged and camouflaged Waterproof Trail Hunting
      Camera is a perfectly equipped covert video recorder for capturing wildlife
      or any would-be trespassers on your land. We have tested dozens of trail cameras
      before settling on this design, as we were amazed at how improved the image
      quality was over other models on the market. Designed for the outdoors, this
      hunting camera can be deployed and installed in an exterior location for months
      at a time. Combining sensitive Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensors and fast triggering
      times should this camera detect the slightest amount of movement it will capture
      detailed video footage of the subject whether it is a deer, a bird or a person.\r\n\r\nVideo
      footage is recorded in 1080p Full HD at a smooth 30 frames per second. Still
      images can also be taken with a resolution of up to 12 megapixels. Paired with
      this is an ultra-low illumination image sensor, which provides improved image
      clarity in dark environments. Furthermore, in total darkness the camera has
      a 25-metre range of night vision with invisible, non-glow infra-red LEDs found
      on the front of the device.\r\n\r\nPower is provided by standard AA batteries
      to remove the need for mains power although an optional mains input is also
      available. Up to 8 months of standby battery life is achievable, thanks to the
      PIR triggering system, which means you do not have to worry about constantly
      replacing the batteries.\r\n\r\nVideos and images are recorded to an SD card,
      which is easily installed in the device's slot. Cards of a capacity of 32GB
      are compatible giving you plenty of recording storage. Configuring settings
      and playing back footage is made simple due to the high-resolution 2\" LCD screen
      that flips out from the bottom of the device. Another helpful feature is the
      laser alignment support. An integrated laser pointer aids installation by making
      the positioning of the camera easier to angle.\r\n\r\nThis kit includes a secure
      strap to make mounting on a fence post or tree easy. With all this in mind this
      makes this camera an ideal outdoor solution for capturing sight of feral visitors
      to the area or to keep an eye on one of your outbuildings. "
