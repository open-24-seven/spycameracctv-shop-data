    description: "Combining the best of both worlds from IP cameras and traditional
      CCTV, this TurboHD TVI security system from Hikvision boasts astounding quality
      1080p HD video along with an intuitive plug-and-play setup. This makes it ideal
      not only for home users looking for the absolute best quality but also for demanding
      retail and commercial security applications.\r\n\r\nTVI technology allows the
      camera to send uncompressed full HD video down a simple RG59 coaxial cable.
      This provides amazingly clear CCTV images full of usable detail. It also means
      that, if you have an existing CCTV system with coaxial cables, you can upgrade
      your cameras and recorder without even having to run new wiring!\r\n\r\n<i>You
      can select the length of cables you need for your system from the drop-down
      at the top of the page or leave it blank if you already have cables and just
      want the cameras and recorder.</i>\r\n\r\nThe cameras themselves are compact
      and discreet and include powerful infra-red night vision that allows the camera
      to see subjects up to 50 metres away in complete darkness. The heavy duty plastic
      casings are also IP66 rated, allowing them to be installed outdoors and exposed
      to the elements without any issues. The dome design makes them a great choice
      for applications like office or retail security.\r\n\r\nThe included 8-channel
      recorder is also made by Hikvision, boasting the standard suite of professional
      DVR features. These include full 1080p recording on all video channels, an HDMI
      output for connecting to a TV or monitor, and highly customisable recording
      options. These allow you to change motion detection or scheduling settings on
      a camera-by-camera basis. It can also be connected by an ethernet cable to your
      router and, once configured, allows secure remote access to watch your cameras
      live over the internet using a PC or smartphone."
