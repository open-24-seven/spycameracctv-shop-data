    description: "This professional grade CCTV cable uses Copper RG59 wire to carry
      a clean video signal with minimal drop-off. When using a professional standard
      camera such as one from our TVI Professional HD Camera range, using sub-standard
      cables can dramatically compromise the resulting image quality. This high quality
      video line ensures your images will remain crisp, sharp and full of detail!\r\n\r\nThis
      Coaxial cable also features a 12V DC power line, fitted with a standard 2.1mm
      jack. This means you can use the same cable to run power out to your cameras,
      and prevents the hassle of having to install two sets of wiring to each camera!\r\n\r\nLooking
      for a different length of cable? We stock these in 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60
      metre lengths, and can even supply massive uncut reels! If you need any help
      with your installation, you can always call our specialist team of advisers.
      Just see our contact page for the easiest way to get in touch!"
