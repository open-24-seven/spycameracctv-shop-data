    description: "Perfect for home security, this wireless spotlight camera adds a
      strong visible deterrent to any one of our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spy/wireless-cameras/portable-lcd-screens/\"
      target=\"_blank\">wireless touchscreen CCTV kits</a>. It features a powerful
      white light illuminator, linked to the built in PIR detector. It can be set
      to switch on whenever a subject moves in front of the camera, clearly letting
      them know that they're being watched. \r\n\r\nAs with the standard cameras available
      for our touchscreen wireless kits, they boast 10m night vision, and 1080p recording
      to help captures as much detail as possible. They even feature two way audio,
      so you can remotely talk to people near the camera using the screen, or the
      mobile app. Digital wireless transmission allows the camera to connect to the
      screen from up to 100m away, with reduced risk of wireless interference."
