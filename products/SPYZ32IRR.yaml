    description: "<strong>B-Grade Product: 20% off</strong>\r\nThis product has either
      been opened, returned by customers, are ex display or have been used for technical
      testing. All products have had some use, some may have cosmetic damage, such
      as screw fixings damage.\r\n\r\nCombining versatile recording and triggering
      modes with the portability of a compact device, our range of battery powered
      spy cameras have proven themselves to be our most popular and reliable covert
      recording solution. This new flagship addition to the range takes this template
      and adds unique features such as a PIR sensor for motion detection, and alarm
      connections. This all combines to make it a powerful security solution, whether
      used as a standalone camera in the home or integrated into an existing alarm
      system in a business setting.\r\n\r\nThe key to the camera's functionality are
      the multiple triggering modes that it can use to start recording. Most prominently,
      the front of the camera is now fitted with a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor,
      letting it detect changes in temperature caused by a subject's body heat. This
      can be then used to trigger motion detection recording, and is far less prone
      to \"accidental\" recordings than other types of motion detection. In addition
      to this, the camera boasts sound activation, vibration detection and traditional
      motion detection- all of which can be activated or disabled separately using
      the free software widget available on the manufacturer's website. \r\n\r\nAnother
      new addition are the camera's <strong>alarm connections</strong>. The device
      has inputs and outputs, allowing you to set it up to be triggered by door sensors
      or smoke detectors as part of a large alarm system, something completely unique
      for a battery powered recorder. The battery itself is a rechargeable Lithium-ion
      unit, capable of recording up to 24 hours of continuous footage on one charge.
      When combined with the PIR or vibration detection mode however, it can remain
      \"armed\" on standby for months at a time!\r\n\r\nAnother new addition is the
      inclusion of infrared LEDs, providing one of the most compact night vision cameras
      in our entire range! The LEDs even use 940nm \"invisible\" IR, meaning there
      is no telltale red glow to give away the camera's location to its subjects.
      The camera can record up to 720p HD resolution, capturing footage directly to
      an internal MicroSD card slot (<i>Please note card not included</i>). This makes
      it possibly our most versatile and advanced standalone video recorder!"
