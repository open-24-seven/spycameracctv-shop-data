    description: "Hikvision's popular Turbo HD range brings outstanding image quality
      and professional features - previously only possible with IP equipment - to
      plug-and-play coaxial cameras. This outdoor bullet camera is no exception, with
      a huge 8MP (3840x2160) resolution, capturing pictures packed with identifiable
      subject detail. This makes it suited to high traffic areas such as shopping
      centres, pubs and bars.\r\n\r\nThe camera's advanced imaging chip also means
      that it can keep recording right down to 0.003 lux before needing night vision,
      providing full colour images much longer into the evening. A 120dB Wide Dynamic
      Range mode also helps improve performance when monitoring high contrast scenes
      such as doorways and windows. When paired with <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/hikvision-turbo-hd-4-channel-dvr-8mp-recording\"
      target=\"_blank\">Hikvision's latest recorder</a>, you can even configure line
      crossing and intrusion detection, triggering automated alerts just like Hikvision's
      IP cameras.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the camera's high grade electronics are protected
      by an IP67 rated weather proof housing, allowing use both indoors and out. EXIR
      illuminators provide 40m night vision range, whilst automatically adjusting
      so as to not overexpose closer subjects. The 2.8mm lens also provides a 102
      degree wide angle field of view, ensuring everything in front of the camera
      is captured on video."
