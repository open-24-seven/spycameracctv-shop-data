    description: "This portable covert security kit has been custom designed as a
      body worn solution for investigators, journalists and mystery shoppers. It features
      a compact, thin camera that connects to a battery powered MicroSD DVR. The camera
      records highly detailed video at 1920x1080 resolution, in lighting levels as
      low as 0.03 lux. The pinhole lens can record through a tiny gap in clothing
      or fabric, or with one of the 5 supplied camouflage \"button\" lenses. It connects
      to the recorder using a lockable 8 pin DIN plug, helping prevent it getting
      tugged out accidentally.\r\n\r\nThe compact recorder is built around a 3\" colour
      touchscreen, providing a quick and intuitive way of editing settings and reviewing
      footage on the MicroSD card. The kit includes a 16GB card as standard, however
      it's compatible with cards up to 32GB. The DVR runs from a 2200maH rechargeable
      battery, allowing up to 3 hours of continuous recording ona  single charge.
      As well as using the screen, you can also view footage and control settings
      using a mobile device, thanks to a built-in Wifi connection."
