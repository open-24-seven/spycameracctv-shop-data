    description: "Cut the cord to your CCTV! This additional camera for our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/gamut-wireless-battery-powered-cctv-system-1080p-camera-1tb-nvr\"
      target=\"_blank\">Gamut battery powered CCTV system</a> is completely wire-free,
      allowing you to install it outside your home without needing to run a cable
      through an exterior wall. This makes it perfect for DIY installers, or for use
      in a rented property.\r\n\r\nThe camera features a built-in PIR sensor, which
      uses a subject's body heat to trigger motion detection. This also allows the
      camera to enter a low-power standby mode, monitoring your property for up to
      6 months on a single charge! Footage is recorded in crisp 1920x1080 Full HD,
      ensuring plenty of picture detail, with IR LEDs also providing 8m of night vision
      illumination for use after dark. The camera connects to the recorder using low
      interference wireless transmission, helping ensure a clean signal."
