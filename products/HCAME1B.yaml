    description: "This rugged and camouflaged waterproof trail wildlife hunting camera
      is a perfectly equipped covert video recorder for capturing wildlife or any
      would-be trespassers on your land. We have tested dozens of trail cameras before
      settling on this design, as we were amazed at how improved the image quality
      was over other models on the market. Designed for the outdoors, this hunting
      camera can be deployed and installed in an exterior location for months at a
      time. Combining sensitive Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensors and fast triggering
      times should this camera detect the slightest amount of movement it will capture
      detailed video footage of the subject whether it is a deer, a bird or a person.\r\n\r\nThe
      improved video quality in this camera is provided by the 1080p Full HD resolution
      and smooth 30 fps frame rate. In addition to this, still images can also be
      captured with a resolution of up to 12 megapixels. To ensure that images are
      effective at night an ultra-low illumination image sensor provides improved
      image clarity in dark environments. Furthermore, in total darkness, the camera
      has a 25-metre range of night vision with invisible, non-glow infra-red LEDs
      found on the front of the device. This ensures that the device is capable in
      all outdoor situations you can throw at it! \r\n\r\nHelpfully, the requirement
      for the camera to powered by the mains is placated as this device can be powered
      by standard AA batteries. An optional mains input is also available. Up to 8
      months of standby battery life is achievable, thanks to the PIR triggering system,
      which means you do not have to worry about constantly replacing the batteries.\r\n\r\nVideos
      and images are recorded to a MicroSD card, which is easily installed in the
      device's slot. Cards of a capacity of 64GB are compatible giving you plenty
      of recording storage. Configuring settings and playing back footage is made
      simple due to the high-resolution 2\" LCD screen that flips out from the bottom
      of the device. Another helpful feature is the laser alignment support. An integrated
      laser pointer aids installation by making the positioning of the camera easier
      to angle.\r\n\r\nThis wildlife camera includes a secure strap to make mounting
      on a fence post or tree easy. With all this in mind, this makes this camera
      an ideal outdoor solution for capturing images of feral visitors to the area
      or to keep an eye on one of your outbuildings."
