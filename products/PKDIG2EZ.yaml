    description: "Wireless CCTV is great option for simple home security, as the cameras
      are easy to install. Instead of running cables across your property, all they
      need is a simple power connection to your mains. This also makes the a great
      choice for securing rented properties. One downside however, is that many wireless
      kits only use basic recorders, storing footage on memory cards. This 2 camera
      wireless CCTV kit includes a fully fledged recorder designed by Hikvision -
      the largest manufacturer of CCTV in the world. This means it combines a simple
      set up with in depth recording options.\r\n\r\nThe 2 cameras use the AHD video
      format to capture sharp pictures in 720p HD. When used after dark, they can
      clearly record subjects up to 15m away using their built in infrared LEDs. A
      durable IP66 rated metal housing provides complete protection from the elements,
      letting the cameras be used outdoors as well as indoors. They transmit video
      back to the included receivers using secure digital wireless technology, providing
      a clean signal with greatly reduced interference, and an extended range of up
      to 100m in direct line of sight.\r\n\r\nThe cameras then send video back to
      the 2 included wireless receivers, which then plug directly into the back of
      the digital video recorder (DVR). The DVR is part of the HiWatch range designed
      by Hikvision, boasting a host of professional quality features at a fraction
      of the usual price. Recording modes include motion detection and scheduling,
      and there are 2 additional channels, letting you expand the system at a later
      date. The HD hybrid DVR can work with AHD, TVI and legacy analogue cameras,
      so you don't have to worry about compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe DVR can also be connected
      to your router. Once configured, this lets you remotely watch live or recorded
      footage on a PC or mobile device, so you can keep an eye on your property wherever
      you are!"
