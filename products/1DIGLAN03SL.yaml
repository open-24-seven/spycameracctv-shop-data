    description: "This complete digital wireless cctv system is a fantastic update
      to one of our most popular home security kits, adding a powerful security light
      to the front of the camera. When triggered, this will illuminate brightly, creating
      a strong deterrent to anyone trying to enter your property.\r\n\r\nThe camera
      still has all of the key features that the existing model boasts, including
      720p HD video recording. The bright spotlight is built into the front of the
      camera, and is triggered by the PIR sensor in the base, which can detect whenever
      a subject moves within a few meters of the camera. The light even has different
      brightness levels that can be set using the recorder. Whilst the light is an
      effective way to put off intruders, the camera is also kitted out with IR LEDs,
      providing 12m of night vision even when the spotlight is off.\r\n\r\nThe camera
      is controlled from a feature packed combination recorder/receiver. The LCD screen
      lets you monitor live or recorded footage without needing a separate TV, and
      it can even work from a rechargeable battery if you need to quickly move it
      around. Thanks to digital wireless transmission, the receiver can pick up the
      camera's signal up to 100m away in direct line of sight, with greatly reduced
      interference. The receiver even has 4 channels, letting you add up to 3 additional
      cameras to the kit (at VGA resolution).\r\n\r\nFootage is recorded to the MicroSD
      card slot (card not included), letting you easily transfer and view footage.
      You can even install the free app onto your smartphone to allow you to easily
      view your camera whilst on the move!"
