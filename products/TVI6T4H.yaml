    description: "This professional grade <strong>TurboHD TVI</strong> security system
      from Hikvision combines the stunning 1080p image quality of an IP camera, with
      the intuitive plug-and-play installation of a traditional CCTV system. This,
      combined with the cameras' massive night vision range and varifocal lenses make
      it a great option for monitoring a large outdoor area.\r\n\r\nThe system uses
      TVI technology in order to send uncompressed 1020x1080p full HD video down an
      RG59 cable (the same kind used in many traditional CCTV kits). This not only
      lets you record incredibly high resolution video files, but also means that
      users upgrading an existing system might even be able to use their current wiring!
      The system uses Power-over-Coax (PoC), letting the cameras draw power from the
      record over the RG59 cable, and removing the need for additional power supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>The
      drop down menu at the top of the page allows you to add which length of cable
      you require. If you are upgrading a current system, then simply leave this blank
      to just buy the cameras and recorder.</i>\r\n\r\nThe included cameras are some
      of the most versatile and robust in Hikvision's range. As well as a massive
      40m of night vision, they are also equipped with varifocal lenses. These allow
      you to manually adjust the field of view from 92-32 degrees, so you can fine
      tune each camera's coverage. Sturdy IP66 rated housings allow the cameras to
      be installed outdoors, withstanding whatever the weather can throw at them.\r\n\r\nAs
      with all of our professional recorders, the included Hikvision DVR allows you
      to adjust settings such as motion detection and scheduling on a camera-by-camera
      basis.  Once connected to your router and configured, the DVR also allows remote
      access to securely view your cameras live online using a PC or smartphone."
