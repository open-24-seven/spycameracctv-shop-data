    description: "<strong>B-grade 25% off</strong>\r\nThis product is a customer return
      or ex-display model. The packaging will have been opened but the contents have
      been fully tested. It might have minor cosmetic defects.\r\n\r\nWith the advent
      of affordable HD-TVI security cameras, you no longer have to break the bank
      to afford a professional quality HD CCTV system. Despite this, there are some
      situations where even the best 1080p camera still doesn't provide enough detail.
      For example higher resolutions make it much easier to keep track of multiple
      subjects in a crowd, or to make out details in subjects further away from the
      camera. Because of this, Hikvision have developed their range of <strong>4 Megapixel</strong>
      IP cameras, recording huge 2688x1520 video files. They do this whilst still
      being an affordable option for small businesses and home users.\r\n\r\nThis
      compact bullet camera crams a high resolution imaging chip into a tiny camera
      body, suited to low profile installations. The camera boasts 20m night vision
      to allow 24/7 recording even in unlit rooms. An IP66 rated weather proof housing
      also means the camera can be used indoors or outdoors. In addition to incredible
      resolution, the camera also allows Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) recording, meaning
      it can still record usable detail even in high contrast scenes, with dark shadows
      or bright highlights.\r\n\r\nThe camera uses Power over Ethernet (PoE), allowing
      it to draw power down the network cable from a compatible recorder or switch.
      This means there is no need for external power supplies, allowing a much simpler
      installation."
