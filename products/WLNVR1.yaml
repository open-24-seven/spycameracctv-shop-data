    description: "Wireless cameras are one of the easiest ways to protect your home,
      with a much quicker setup than traditional CCTV. One common cause of confusion,
      however, is that wireless CCTV <em>still needs to be connected to a power supply</em>,
      so that it can transmit. So what if you're not able to run cables at all around
      your property? This new Gamut battery-powered CCTV system is the ideal solution,
      with a camera powered by a Lithium-Ion battery, for a completely wire-free installation.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera is fitted with a PIR sensor, so it can detect a moving subject's body
      heat in order to trigger recording. This helps save battery power in between
      use, allowing up to 6 months' monitoring on a single charge. Footage is recorded
      in clear 1080p HD, with infrared LEDs providing 8m night vision. The camera
      even has a built-in speaker, so you can talk back to subjects near the camera
      from your phone. When the battery needs charging, you can easily undock it from
      the camera base without taking it down from the wall.\r\n\r\nThe kit also includes
      a wireless recorder with a preinstalled 1TB hard drive to store footage. The
      recorder can connect to up to 6 cameras at the same time, providing an easy
      way to expand your system at a later date. The recorder connects to your internet
      router, letting you securely watch & control your cameras from anywhere, using
      a PC or smartphone.\r\n\r\n<strong>Please note:</strong> As with all wireless
      transmissions, the range of the camera will vary depending on the layout and
      materials used in the building. Obstructions such as walls and windows between
      the camera and receiver will affect the wireless signal. </span><a href=\"https://help.spycameracctv.com/getting-the-best-range-from-your-wireless-cameras/\"
