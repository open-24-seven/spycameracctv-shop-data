    description: "We always recommend using a junction box when installing IP cameras
      on the exterior of a building. This Hikvision junction is designed to fit the
      connectors for a Hikvision turret camera, protecting them from vandals and the
      elements.\r\n\r\nThe junction box also makes installing the camera so much easier,
      as it means you no longer have to drill large holes in exterior walls to feed
      through the ethernet connection."
