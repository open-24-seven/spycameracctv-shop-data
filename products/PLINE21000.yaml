    description: "This set of two easy to use powerline adapters is one of the easiest
      ways available to extend a wired internet connection around your home or office.
      These small devices simply plug into your mains power supplies, and let you
      run a network around your building's electrical circuit, instead of using a
      telephone line or ethernet cable. \r\n\r\nBut just what does this mean for CCTV?
      Simply put, it lets you easily connect your CCTV DVR to a router in another
      room, without having to run a length of cable between the two. Not only does
      this provide a much easier installation, but it lets you keep your recorder
      tucked away in a loft or private room, helping keep your recordings secure.\r\n\r\nThere
      is no tricky network configuration required. Just plug the device you want to
      connect in to one of the adapters, and then plug your router into the second
      one. Then all you need to do is pair them together using the buttons on the
      devices, and you're ready to go. As the devices need to be paired, the connection
      remains secure from external devices. The kit is capable of data transfer rates
      up to 1000Mbps, and working across 300m of circuitry. Please note, adapters
      must be connected on the same electrical circuit. This kit also features pass-through
      power, so you still have a spare socket to use even when the device is plugged
      in."
