    description: "A good quality CCTV system is one of the most important assets a
      small business can have, helping protect both people and property. There are
      some situations however, where traditional dome or bullet cameras would not
      be suitable, such as trying to monitor a stock room for staff theft. With these
      delicate situations in mind, we have put together this complete 2 camera covert
      security system. Crucially, the included Gamut TVI pinhole cameras mean you
      don't have to choose between discreet cameras and a quality picture.\r\n\r\nThe
      included cameras are tiny â€“ measuring only 35 milimetres across â€“ allowing
      it to be concealed from view. The conical pinhole lens is designed to see through
      gaps as small as 2mm wide, so you can easily hide them out of view on a shelf
      or in a suspended ceiling. The cameras record in colour until it gets dark,
      when they switch to black and white in order to boost sensitivity down to 0.01
      Lux. \r\n\r\nOur TVI cameras record in 1080p Full HD, making them amongst the
      highest resolution pinhole cameras on the market. They connect to the recorder
      using standard plug-and-play AV cables and BNC connectors, so if you have an
      existing CCTV system you may even be able to use your existing wiring!\r\n\r\nThe
      kit also includes a 4 channel Hybrid CCTV DVR, capable of recording and playing
      back the video in Full HD over HDMI. It features a fell suite of settings such
      as motion detection and scheduling, as well as remote access via PC or mobile.
      Footage is recorded to a pre-installed hard drive - just select the size required
      from the drop down menu at the top of the page. The recorder actually uses a
      hybrid HD system, which lets it capture footage from almost every HD CCTV format
      on the market, as well as traditional analogue cameras. This means it is incredibly
      easy to add up to 2 extra cameras to the recorder if you want to expand the
      system at a later date."
