    description: "This mini PTZ controller is a fantastic addition to any analogue
      pan tilt zoom CCTV system, providing intuitive camera control. The compact unit
      features a 3D joystick that puts the camera's movements right at your fingertips.
      This provides far more precise control than using a DVR's remote controls, or
      using an onscreen interface, and makes it simple to actively track subjects
      as they move past the camera. \r\n\r\nThe controller connects to the camera
      using RS485 plugs and wire, and is compatible with a range of protocols, including
      PELCO D and PELCO C, as well as with Dahua cameras. In addition to directly
      controlling the camera, it also lets you program preset camera positions and
      routes that can be called up at the touch of a button. This lets you easily
      automate your system's coverage."
