      target=\"_blank\">1080p digital wireless kit</a>, letting you easily expand
      your home security system's coverage. The recorder can work with up to 4 cameras,
      recording every one of them in 1080p Full HD quality.\r\n\r\nNew compression
      technology allows the camera to send 1920x1080 (2 megapixel) images over wireless
      - something previously impossible. The camera is also fitted with a passive
      infrared (PIR) sensor, able to detect a subject's body heat and use it to trigger
      recording. This is much more accurate than traditional motion detection, reducing
      the amount of accidental recordings you have to review. The camera records in
      full colour during daylight, and after dark switches to night vision with 10m
      range.\r\n\r\nThe signal is sent to the receiver using advanced digital wireless
      transmission. This helps greatly reduce interference from other wireless devices,
      and allows a much greater range than traditional wireless devices - up to 100m
      in clear line of sight. If you need more range, we also have external antenna
      available that can be connected to the camera."
