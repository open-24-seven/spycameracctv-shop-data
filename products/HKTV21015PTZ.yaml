    description: "Pan-tilt-zoom (or PTZ) cameras are mounted to a motorised base,
      letting you remotely control their position. This makes them a fantastic option
      for easily monitoring larger spaces that would otherwise need multiple cameras,
      or for tracking moving subjects. This Hikvision Turbo HD camera uses the HD-TVI
      format, letting you send high resolution video and camera movement commands
      all over one standard BNC cable. \r\n\r\nAs well as the motorised base, the
      camera is fitted with a 15x optical zoom lens, able to move from a 53 degree
      field of view, to a tight 4 degree angle. When combined with the 1080p Full
      HD sensor, this allows you to capture incredibly fine levels of subject detail.
      This is essential when used in areas with lots of foot traffic, or for capturing
      number plates in car parks. All of the electronics are protected by an IP66
      rated weatherproof case, allowing outdoor installation.\r\n\r\nOnce connected
      to a Hikvision DVR, you can either control the camera using the recorder's built-in
      interface, or by using the Hikvision PC app. For direct fingertip control, connect
      the DVR to one of our range of dedicated PTZ joystick controllers. The camera
      can then be moved manually, or programmed with up to 256 preset positions and
      10 patrol patterns. You can even set the camera to carry out patrol movements
      at regular timed intervals."
