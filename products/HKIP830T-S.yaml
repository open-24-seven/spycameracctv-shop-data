    description: "Whilst 1080p HD cameras record great amounts of detail - and are
      incredibly cost effective with modern technology - even they don't have the
      resolution needed for the most demanding applications. If you need to capture
      an individual's face clearly, or need to simultaneously monitor multiple parts
      of an image, then it's worth upgrading to an 8 megapixel camera. Hikvision's
      4K CCTV range records at 3840x2160 resolution, capturing <i>four times</i> the
      detail of 1080p.\r\n\r\nThis turret CCTV camera packs this imaging technology
      into a compact package, ideal for use in a bar or shop. The discreet housing
      helpds protect the camera, and is IP67 rated, allowing installation in even
      the most exposed outdoor locations. Despite it's small size, it uses an IR array
      to provide 30m of clear night vision illumination. It also includes a 2.8mm
      wide angle lens, providing a 102Â° field of view.\r\n\r\nThe IP camera connects
      directly to your network using an ethernet cable, or into a network video recorder.
      It uses PoE, allowing it to draw power from the cable instead of relying on
      a power supply (compatible switch or router required). Once configured, the
      camera can be viewed and controlled from a PC, ad footage can be recorded to
      the on-board MicroSD card slot (up to 128GB cards, not included). as with all
      of Hikvision's professional IP cameras, it also boasts a range of smart features,
      including facial recognition and intruder detection."
