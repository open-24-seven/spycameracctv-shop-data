    description: "Hikvision has long had a reputation as making some of the most powerful
      surveillance kit on the market, long used by governments and commercial installers.
      They have put together their popular range of <strong>HiWatch</strong> cameras
      and recorders as a way to bring this dependable image and build quality to home
      and DIY installers. This 4 camera HiWatch CCTV system is a perfect example,
      featuring HD turret cameras and a DVR. It all goes together using standard twist-fit
      BNC cables, so it's a great option if you want to upgrade an older kit without
      rewiring your house.\r\n\r\nDespite their discreet size, the turret housings
      protecting each camera are rated IP66, allowing them to be used either indoors
      or outdoors. They also each boast 20m night vision, allowing them to clearly
      see intruders on your property even in total darkness. Pictures are captured
      with a high grade 1080p sensor, recording full, true-to-life colour in daylight.\r\n\r\nThe
      included HiWatch DVR has many of the recording features found on it's bigger
      brothers. This includes motion detection and 24/7 scheduling, all adjustable
      camera-by-camera. Footage is recorded onto your choice of hard drive at 1080lite
      quality, allowing you to hold many days' worth of clips at a time. You can also
      connect the DVR to your router, allowing you to configure remote access to cameras
      and recording settings from a PC or mobile device."
