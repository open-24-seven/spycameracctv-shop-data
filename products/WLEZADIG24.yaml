    description: "Here at SpyCameraCCTV we have been providing bespoke animal monitoring
      kits to farmers for over 5 years. Our kits help to provide peace of mind, allowing
      you to keep a close eye on your livestock from the comfort of your farmhouse.
      This wireless lambing camera kit is the latest in our range of specialist kits,
      featuring not only a 20m night vision camera, but a USB connector that allows
      you to easily watch footage on your PC.\r\n\r\nThe kit consists of a CCTV camera
      & microphone, a wireless transmitter and receiver pack, and all of the required
      connectors to get the camera up and running. The camera itself is a compact
      bullet design, making it easy to mount on the side of your barn or lambing shed.
      It's fully weatherproof, and features powerful night vision LEDs, allowing it
      to keep watch over your animals day and night. We have also included a small
      microphone to install next to the camera, allowing you to hear if one of your
      animals is in distress.\r\n\r\nThe camera & microphone wires straight into the
      receiver using one of the included 10m cables, and then this transmits the audio
      & video to the receiver- up to 100m away in clear line of sight. We have included
      2 high gain antennae as well, which can be placed around your buildings to optimise
      the signal. <i>Please note- camera and wireless transmitters will require a
      local power supply.</i>\r\n\r\nYou can then simply plug the receiver into the
      back of your TV, and watch your animals from the comfort of your sofa."
