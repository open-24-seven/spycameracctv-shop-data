    description: "The remote control provided by pan, tilt, zoom (or PTZ) cameras
      make them ideal for monitoring large outdoor spaces, or situations such as car
      parks where you need to monitor moving subjects. This PTZ camera from Hikvision
      packs in a host of professional security features such as line crossing and
      intrusion detection, all at great price perfect for small businesses.\r\n\r\nAt
      the heart of the camera is a 2mp, high sensitivity imaging chip, capable of
      recording full colour in conditions as dark as 0.005 lux. When light levels
      drop below this, an array of powerful infrared LEDs provide night vision for
      subjects up to 100m away (at maximum zoom). The lens features 15x optical zoom,
      covering everything from a 61Â° field of view at the wide end, to a tight 5Â°
      crop for close detail.\r\n\r\nThe IP camera connects to your network using a
      standard Cat6 cable. If connected to a PoE+ compatible switch or recorder, then
      the camera does not need an additional power supply. Once configured, you can
      view and control the camera either directly on a PC or mobile device, or via
      a Hikvision NVR. This also lets you control all of Hikvision's video analytics,
      including line crossing, intrusion, object removal and region exit detection."
