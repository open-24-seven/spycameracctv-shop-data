    description: "This <strong>TurboHD TVI</strong> security system from Hikvision
      combines the pin-sharp 1080p image quality of an HD IP system, with the intuitive
      plug and play setup of traditional CCTV. This makes it one of the best kits
      out there for commercial security on business properties such as shops and offices.\r\n\r\nTVI
      technology allows the cameras to send stunning quality uncompressed Full HD
      video down a standard RG59 cable- the type used in almost every good quality
      traditional CCTV system. This not only provides you with incredibly high resolution
      footage, but also means that, if you already have CCTV on your property, you
      may even be able to use your current cabling. This makes it a fantastic option
      for upgrading an existing kit.\r\n\r\n<i>You can select the quantity of cabling
      required using the drop down menu at the top of the page. If you already have
      RG59 cables on your property then just leave it blank, and just go for the recorder
      and cameras!</i>\r\n\r\nThe kit includes 8 compact bullet cameras, giving you
      enough coverage to monitor a large retail space or smaller office or industrial
      unit. The cameras feature 20m of clear night vision illumination, as well as
      IP66 rated housings to allow outdoor installation. Despite this, they have an
      impressively small and discreet design.\r\n\r\nThe recorder is also a fully
      fledged TurboHD model from Hikvision, capable of recording 1920x1080p footage
      from each camera independently. As with all of our professional recorders, it
      also allows detailed customisation of motion detection and scheduling on a camera-by-camera
      basis. Once connected to your router and configured, the recorder also allows
      secure remote access using either a PC or your smartphone."
