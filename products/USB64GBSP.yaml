    description: "This i-Series USB 2.0 memory stick by Silicon Power packs in a massive
      64GB of storage, despite it's compact size. This makes it the ideal way to easily
      transfer CCTV footage from your DVR's hard drive to another computer or device-
      essential if you have to hand important clips to the authorities. As with all
      USB sticks it's also a simple way to store or backup your photos, music and
      documents.\r\n\r\nThe stick itself is housed in a sleek metal casing, and features
      a protective plastic cap over it's contacts. It uses the standard USB 2.0 protocol,
      so installing it is as simple as plugging it in to your computer, and then dragging
      and dropping the files- that's all there is to it!"
