    description: "Combining the best of both worlds from IP cameras and traditional
      CCTV, this TurboHD TVI 4 camera CCTV system from Hikvision boasts astounding
      quality 1080p HD video, along with an intuitive plug-and-play setup. This makes
      it ideal not only for home users looking for the absolute best quality, but
      also for demanding retail and commercial security applications.\r\n\r\nTVI technology
      allows the CCTV cameras to send uncompressed full HD video down a simple RG59
      coaxial cable. This provides amazingly clear CCTV images full of usable detail.
      It also means that, if you have an existing CCTV system with coaxial cables,
      you can upgrade your cameras and recorder without even having to run new wiring!
      The system uses Power-over-Coax (PoC), letting the cameras draw power from the
      record over the RG59 cable, and removing the need for additional power supplies.\r\n\r\n<i>You
      can select the length of cables you need for your 4 camera Hikvision CCTV system
      from the dropdown at the top of the page, or leave it blank if you already have
      cables and just want the cameras and recorder.</i>\r\n\r\nThe cameras themselves
      are compact and discreet, but don't let that fool you- they pack a 20m night
      vision range for round the clock monitoring. The heavy duty plastic casings
      are also IP66 rated, allowing them to be installed outdoors and exposed to the
      elements without any issues. The dome design makes them a great choice for applications
      like office or retail security.\r\n\r\nThe included recorder is also made by
      Hikvision, boasting the standard suite of professional DVR features. These include
      full 1080p recording on all video channels, an HDMI output for connecting to
      a TV or monitor, and highly customisable recording options. These allow you
      to change motion detection or scheduling settings on a camera-by-camera basis.
      It can also be connected by an ethernet cable to your router and, once configured,
      allows secure remote access to watch your cameras live over the internet using
      a PC or smartphone."
