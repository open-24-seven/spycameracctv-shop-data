    description: "Hikvision is the industry leader for CCTV technology, making professional
      grade workhorses with incredible recording resolutions. For home users, however,
      much of their equipment is prohibitively expensive, or complex to configure.
      Because of this, they have designed the <strong>HiWatch</strong> range, providing
      reliable, high resolution monitoring that's easy to install and is great value
      for home users. This home security system uses  4 HiWatch HD turret cameras,
      along with an HD hybrid recorder from Gamut.\r\n\r\nEach camera records 1920x1080
      Full HD footage, with enough subject detail to provide reliably clear evidence.
      Not only this, but each camera features 20m night vision, and IP66 weatherproof
      housings, making them perfect for round-the-clock indoor or outdoor use. The
      4-in-1 technology means they just connect to the recorder using plug and play
      coaxial cables, with no network configuration required. \r\n\r\n<i>You can add
      the required length of cables to your system using the drop down at the top
      of the page, or choose to leave them out if you're upgrading a legacy system
      with an existing cable run.</i>\r\n\r\nThe system also includes a professional
      grade HD CCTV recorder from Gamut. As with all of our DVRs, this boasts a wide
      range of motion detection and scheduling settings, all adjustable on a camera-by-camera
      basis. The recorder also connects to your router, which once configured lets
      you watch live or recorded footage remotely from anywhere using a phone, tablet
      or PC."
