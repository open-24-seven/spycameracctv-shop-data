    description: "8 Megapixel - or 4K - is the flagship video quality for CCTV systems,
      recording four times the level of detail of Full HD cameras. It's perfect for
      applications where you need to pick out specific details from a large scene,
      such as customers in a bar or large shop. The extra resolution also helps capture
      fine details such as faces and license plates. Traditionally, however, this
      level of quality has been reserved for commercial grade IP systems, requiring
      in depth network configuration. Luckily, Hikvision's latest line of Turbo HD
      TVI cameras can now record full 8MP resolution, all using simple plug-and-play,
      twist fit BNC connectors.\r\n\r\nAs part of this unique range, this 3 camera
      system includes 4 dome cameras and a DVR to control recording. Each camera captures
      detail packed 3840x2160 video, with powerful infra red LEDs to provide 40m night
      vision after dark. The dome housings are both weather proof and vandal proof,
      allowing them to be used either indoors or outdoors, even in exposed positions.
      They also boast a range of adjustable picture controls, including WDR and noise
      removal, to help ensure a clear image even in challenging lighting.\r\n\r\nThe
      DVR is also part of Hikvision's Turbo HD range, and is capable of recording
      footage from the cameras without any loss in resolution. Recording settings
      are adjustable for each of the 4 video channels, with features including motion
      detection, scheduling, and even smart detection such as line crossing. A network
      connection also lets you plug the DVR into your router in order to configure
      remote access from PC, mobile or tablet."
