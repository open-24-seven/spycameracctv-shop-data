    description: "We have years of experience designing bespoke CCTV kits for remotely
      monitoring livestock across large farm properties. Now, for the first time,
      we are able to combine this expertise with the latest Pan-Tilt-Zoom camera technology
      from Hikvision. This system lets you remotely control the camera in your barn,
      rotating and zooming the lens to focus on specific animals, all controlled by
      a PC or phone.\r\n\r\nThe camera connects to your home's internet using a long
      range Wifi bridge, capable of sending the signal up to 3km in direct line of
      sight, essential for farms spread over large properties. Once configured to
      your network, Hikvision's software not only lets you move the camera, but also
      includes their latest smart detection features. Settings such as line crossing
      and object removal detection let you easily automate monitoring. You can even
      add one of our PTZ joysticks, putting the camera controls right at your fingertips.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera itself is probably the most advanced to have ever been added to one of
      our livestock CCTV systems. It boasts 15x optical zoom, letting you move from
      a wide angle, to a view focussed on one animal's face. At the top end of the
      zoom, the IR LEDs provide up to 100m night vision, automatically reducing power
      for closer subjects. The 1080p Full HD sensor can even record in full colour
      right down to 0.005 lux, ideal for badly lit interiors."
