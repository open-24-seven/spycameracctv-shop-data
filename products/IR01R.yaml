    description: "This compact kit is simply a great entry level CCTV system. Its
      ideal for keeping an eye on your car, shed, front door or even your children!
      The infrared night vision camera will wirelessly transmit the video to the compact
      receiver unit, which can then be easily connected to a TV, or DVR. A business
      owner could even use it to monitor operations in an office or shop. As with
      all of our comprehensive packages, all of the required leads are included. When
      it arrives you can just plug it in and it's ready to go.\r\n\r\nDespite being
      only roughly the size of a pool ball, don't let it's unassuming exterior fool
      you! The camera actually boasts a host of features making it an impressively
      versatile little piece of equipment. Most notably, the camera is fitted with
      an array of 30 infrared LEDs. This provides illumination for night vision up
      to 10m away, perfect for mounting next to your front door, or over a side access
      pathway. The LEDs are fitted with a photosensitive detector, letting them automatically
      switch on when the light level falls below a certain level. The camera's tiny
      imaging chip records 380 TV lines of detail and when in daylight records in
      glorious full colour. The integrated lens can also be focussed, allowing you
      to precisely adjust the image.\r\n\r\nThe camera is encased in a waterproof
      housing, so it can be installed outside and exposed to the elements. Included
      in the package is a 12-volt power supply to connect to the camera, our recommended
      method. This allows the camera to stay on indefinitely, 24 hours a day- a necessity
      if it's being used as a security camera. However it is powered, the camera can
      transmit video to the wireless receiver from a range of up to 50m, depending
      on obstacles. "
