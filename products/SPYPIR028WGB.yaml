    description: "Concerned about items going missing in the office? Looking for a
      way to discreetly monitor what's happening in the stock room from the manager's
      office? This type of covert surveillance calls for a small camera that won't
      easily be noticed, and an easy way of monitoring it without tell-tale AV cables
      trailing from the device. Luckily, this 960p HD PIR Spy Camera with WiFi is
      the perfect solution, offering several ways to keep an eye on your property.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera features 2 ways to let you remotely log in and view live footage on a
      smartphone. If it's installed in an area with an existing Wifi network then
      the camera can connect to your router. This allows you to securely log in and
      view footage from anywhere in the world, perfect if you have to check your business
      whilst you are away. Even if there is no existing network, the camera can also
      act as a P2P Wifi hotspot. This lets you connect directly to the camera from
      your phone within a 100m range, for example discreetly monitoring it from another
      room. \r\n\r\nThanks to it's PIR detector housing, this model can be installed
      on an interior wall not attract any attention- simply looking like a lighting
      motion detector. This, however, conceals a tiny camera capable of recording
      video footage at 1280x960p HD. The unit even includes IR night vision LEDs,
      allowing it to record footage in complete darkness. In addition to the Wifi
      features, motion detection recording and a MicroSD card storage slot, allowing
      you to leave it monitoring a room and check footage later. \r\n\r\nThe camera
      features a Lithium rechargeable battery that allows recording for up to 45 minutes
      per charge. You can also power up the device using the included USB cable."
