    description: "Looking to upgrade your existing CCTV system? This 16 channel DVR
      from Hikvision is ideal. With maximum compatibility in mind this recorder works
      with legacy analogue cameras as well as Full HD TVI cameras. This means you
      can mix-and-match pre-existing cameras with cutting-edge 5MP TVI models. If
      you want a fully-fledged 16 camera 5MP system this recorder is more than capable
      of recording the cameras at full resolution for synchronous playback. It even
      supports up to two 6MP IP cameras, letting you easily combine analogue and digital
      cameras in one system. This makes this hybrid recorder excellent for medium-to-large
      commercial site applications.\r\n\r\nThis recorder is compatible with Hikvision's
      Turbo 4.0 and H.265+ encoding. This new technology improves storage efficiency
      by using a more intelligent encoding algorithm that means footage takes up less
      space on your chosen hard drive. \r\n\r\nFeaturing all the important functions
      you'd expect, this Hikvision recorder will serve every surveillance need. Fully
      adjustable smart recording modes incuding line crossing and intrusion detection
      mean you can customise the recording to your specification. When it comes to
      remote access Hikvision make it as easy as possible to set up networking. You
      can even view footage from your smartphone using the app for iOS, Android and
      Windows Phone."
