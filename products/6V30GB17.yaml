    description: "Our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/search/?search=hcam\"
      target=\"new\">standard and HD hunting cameras</a> are one of our most versatile
      and popular product lines, allowing you to monitor remote areas with ease. This
      compact mains power supply allows you to use their sensitive PIR triggers in
      a more permanent installation, by powering the camera directly. This also helps
      save on battery costs if you know the camera is going to stay in one location
      and be frequently triggered. \r\n\r\nThe attached cable is approximately 1.5m
      in length, and is fitted with a standard 1.7mm jack. *Please note, this power
      supply will not recharge batteries inside of the device.*"
