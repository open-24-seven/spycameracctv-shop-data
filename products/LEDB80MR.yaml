    description: "<strong>B-grade item: 25% off</strong>\r\nThis item is likely a
      customer return or an ex-display model that is in a good condition but may have
      some light cosmetic damage. \r\n\r\nNight vision is essential when using CCTV
      to monitor unlit areas such as gardens and driveways, however, the IR LEDs built
      into cameras do have their limitations. They are often not powerful enough for
      larger areas and usually have a very narrow field of view. This powerful IR
      illuminator is a great way to extend your system's coverage. \r\n\r\nThe weather
      resistant bank of IR LEDs is mounted on an adjustable bracket, letting you easily
      direct them towards the desired subject. This provides a versatile independent
      source of light, which you can use to light up certain areas of the image, or
      even just extend the range of your cameras. The floodlight can illuminate subjects
      up to 50m away and will work with almost all CCTV cameras."
