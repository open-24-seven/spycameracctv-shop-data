    description: "Wireless pan/tilt cameras are an incredibly popular way to keep
      an eye on your home or office, letting you remotely move the camera on a motorised
      base. This flexibility makes them ideally suited to everything from home security,
      to keeping an eye on your pet whilst out and about, or even as a baby monitor.
      This unique kit pairs the camera with a dedicated 9\" colour screen to watch
      live and recorded footage. The screen even works with many of our digital wireless
      security cameras, letting you combine outdoor bullet and indoor pan/tilt cameras
      all in one simple to use system!\r\n\r\nThe camera itself records in clear and
      crisp 720p HD. Infa red LEDs provide 8m of night vision, so you can still see
      everything in the room even in complete darkness. The camera can be simply placed
      on a table or desk, or you can use the included clip-in bracket to mount it
      securely on the ceiling or wall. As well as the pan tilt base, it's also kitted
      out with a speaker, letting you talk back through the camera by speaking into
      a microphone on the screen.\r\n\r\nThe included 9\" screen also acts as a wireless
      receiver and MicroSD recorder, so you can have a dedicated device to monitor
      the camera. Pan & tilt movements can be controlled either by the screen's buttons,
      or with your phone using the easy-to-connect mobile app. The screen also boasts
      a built-in rechargeable battery, so you can easily move it around with needing
      to re-pair the camera. As with all of our CCTV recorders, it comes with a full
      range of motion detection and scheduling options to record footage to the MicroSD
      card. <i>Please note, class 10 card required, not included</i>.\r\n"
