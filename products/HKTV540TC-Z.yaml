    description: "Hikvision's Turbo HD-TVI is one of the most popular camera ranges
      from one of the most trusted names in security. They boast fantastic high definition
      image quality, all through a simple plug-and-play cable. This means you can
      get the same results as an HD IP camera without the hassle of configuring it
      onto your network. This outdoor turret camera is one of the latest in this range,
      with an incredible <i>5 Megapixel</i> recording resolution- that's 2592x1944
      video!\r\n\r\nThe camera pairs also features a motorised zoom lens, letting
      you remotely adjust the camera's field of view from a wide 86Â° to a narrow
      28Â°. Paired with the massive recording resolution, this lets you capture fine
      subject detail such as faces and clothes. Other features include 40m night vision
      range for round-the-clock monitoring even in large spaces. The camera is housed
      in an IP67 rated turret housing, making it suitable for indoor or outdoor use.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera uses a standard twist-fit BNC output, so can plug straight in to any
      HD-TVI compatible recorder. It even supports Power-over-Coax (PoC), letting
      it draw power from a compatible DVR over the RG59 cable, and removing the need
      for an additional power supply."
