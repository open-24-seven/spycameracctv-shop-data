    description: "This <strong>HD TVI</strong> security system combines the pin-sharp
      1080p image quality of an HD IP system, with the intuitive plug and play setup
      of traditional CCTV. This makes it one of the best kits out there for commercial
      security on business properties such as shops and offices.\r\n\r\nTVI technology
      allows the cameras to send stunning quality uncompressed Full HD video down
      a standard RG59 cable- the type used in almost every good quality traditional
      CCTV system. This not only provides you with incredibly high resolution footage,
      but also means that, if you already have CCTV on your property, you may even
      be able to use your current cabling. This makes it a fantastic option for upgrading
      an existing kit.\r\n\r\n<i>You can select the quantity of cabling required using
      the drop down menu at the top of the page. If you already have RG59 cables on
      your property then just leave it blank, and just go for the recorder and cameras!</i>\r\n\r\nThe
      kit includes 8 Hikvision bullet cameras, giving you enough coverage to monitor
      a large retail space or smaller office or industrial unit. The cameras feature
      20m of clear night vision illumination, as well as IP66 rated housings to allow
      outdoor installation. Despite this, they have an impressively small and discreet
      design.\r\n\r\nThe recorder is also a fully fledged TurboHD model from Gamut,
      capable of recording 1920x1080p footage from each camera independently. As with
      all of our professional recorders, it also allows detailed customisation of
      motion detection and scheduling on a camera-by-camera basis. Once connected
      to your router and configured, the recorder also allows secure remote access
      using either a PC or your smartphone."
