      hunting cameras</a> are a fantastic way to monitor areas or properties where
      there is no power. They have been used to secure allotments, farms, gardens,
      and to prevent fly-tipping, amongst countless other uses. In some situations
      however, they can be vulnerable to theft or vandalism. This lockable metal security
      box is the perfect solution, keeping your camera under lock and key, whilst
      still able to record and trigger via PIR.\r\n\r\nThe box is designed specifically
      for our camera and fits snugly and securely. An adjustable stand lets you perfectly
      position the camera for optimum coverage. The case can also be locked to a secure
      point such as a fence or tree to prevent it being moved."
