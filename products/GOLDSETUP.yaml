      with a network enabled recorder and more than 4 cameras</li>\r\nâ€¢ Professional
      grade multi IP camera security systems (cost includes up to 8 IP cameras)\r\nâ€¢
      Commercial users with business-critical CCTV coverage</li>\r\nâ€¢ Users with
      systems that include a Wifi bridge or 4G router</li>\r\n\r\n<strong>Who is this
      service not right for?</strong>\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Users with more than 8 cameras and
      a recorder</li>\r\n\r\n<i>For these situations we recommend our platinum support
      package</i>\r\n\r\nIP security camera systems are at the cutting edge of CCTV
      technology, letting you record HD footage from many cameras connected directly
      to your network. Of course, for some the configuration needed to get such a
      system up and running can be daunting, especially those with less knowledge
      of networking or routers. That's why we have put together this all-inclusive,
      comprehensive support package. This remote service not only takes the stress
      out of getting your IP system up and running, but provides professional grade
      support suitable for the most demanding commercial security requirements.\r\n\r\nAfter
      the initial setup call, a simple annual Direct Debit subscription can then be
      set up. This provides ongoing support should there be an issue with your connection,
      as well as free on-site exchanges of equipment via our courier for the duration
      of the product warranty. This means you won't have to wait to for items to be
      exchanged, and is ideal for those running security on a commercial property.\r\n\r\nLogging
      remotely in to your network, our expert team of technicians will completely
      configure your cameras, NVR, software and router, allowing online viewing over
      a PC and on mobile devices. The service can include configuring recorder settings,
      as well as camera-based smart features such as line crossing. We will also set
      up a web address through which you can securely log in to view your cameras.
      The service will take around an hour, depending on how many cameras need configuring.
      During this time you can either get our support agent to walk you through the
      process on the phone, or just relax with a tea! We do however ask that you are
      available by the computer in case we need to check anything."
