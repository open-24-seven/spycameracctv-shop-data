    description: "Our <strong>Gamut Network Video Recorder</strong> (NVR) offers top-of-the-line
      performance and adaptability. It is ideal for small to medium-scale systems
      where superior image quality is a must. This model can capture up to 4 IP cameras
      at 1080p Full HD. Installation is very simple as cameras are detected automatically
      when they are connected to the recorder. A user-friendly interface for configuring
      network settings and camera control is available so that the recorder can be
      customized with ease.\r\n\r\nIntegrated into this CCTV NVR is a 4 port Power
      over Ethernet (PoE) switch so that up to 4 IP cameras can be powered over the
      same network cable that transfers data to the recorder. This is extremely useful
      for keeping the cost and amount of cabling down to an absolute minimum.\r\n\r\nWhen
      you integrate the recorder into your network this allows the benefit of remote
      access for live viewing, playback and control without having to be physically
      near the unit. You can access the recorder remotely over a web interface or
      via a mobile device.\r\n"
