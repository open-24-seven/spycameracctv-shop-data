    description: "Perhaps the ultimate proof that big things can come in small packages,
      this compact bullet camera from Hikvision packs 8 megapixel recording resolution.
      It's a perfect IP camera for any application that calls for a small & unobtrusive
      camera that doesn't compromise on image quality.\r\n\r\nA high grade CMOS imaging
      chip allows the camera to capture footage at resolutions up to 3840x2160, recording
      4 times the subject detail of even Full HD. This is perfect for monitoring people
      in high traffic areas such as bars or retail spaces, and makes it easier than
      ever to archive vital details such as faces and licence plates. It also boasts
      powerful IR LEDs that provide 30m night vision illumination, as well as a durable
      IP67 rated housing, essential for outdoor installation.\r\n\r\nThe PoE camera
      can connect to your network via a router or switch, letting you watch live or
      recorded footage from anywhere using a PC, or Hikvision's mobile app. As part
      of Hikvision's professional IP range, it also has a huge range of smart features,
      including line crossing, intrusion, object removal and face detection. These
      are all fully customisable using Hikvision's software, giving you another level
      of control over your security system's automation.\r\n"
