    description: "When designing this fantastic value Wireless 4 Camera Foaling CCTV
      Kit, we drew on all of our years of experience creating specialist farm security
      systems. This kit combines our high grade Night Vision Security Cameras with
      long range wireless transmission, providing wide scope for keeping your property
      secure. We have designed this with Farm Security in mind, but don't let that
      stop you- it's an ideal package for anyone who needs to secure a large property
      from up to 200m away.\r\n\r\nThis is a <strong>partially wired</strong> kit,
      meaning that it uses wired CCTV cameras connected to a hybrid professional 4
      channel DVR. The signal from this device is then transmitted, meaning you only
      have to shell out for one Transmitter/Receiver kit, saving <strong>over Â£300!</strong>
      This system is ideal for covering different areas of a barn, warehouse or stable.
      \r\n\r\nFor unmatched clarity and ease of installation, this kit uses our latest
      Digital Wireless Transmitters, massively reducing interference, and boosting
      the unit's range to up to 200m! Please note, as with all Wireless CCTV, this
      will be reduced by half when going through solid obstructions.\r\n\r\nAs with
      our Wired CCTV Systems, this kit uses durable outdoor CCTV cameras capable of
      20m of IR Night Vision- essential for use in unlit areas! These are then matched
      up with an advanced Digital Video Recorder boasting an adjustable Motion Detection
      mode. This feature will initiate recording on any of the unit's 4 channels when
      it senses movement, ideal for keeping a look out for intruders. This can even
      be fine tuned by changing sensitivity levels and masking out areas of the image.
      By using these controls you can make the built in 1TB Hard Drive last even longer!\r\n\r\nHere
      at SpyCameraCCTV we have years of experience with Wireless CCTV. If you have
      any questions or would even like us to put together a bespoke system, just check
