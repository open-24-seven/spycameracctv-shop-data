    description: "The <strong>HiWatch</strong> range has been designed by Hikvision
      - the world's largest CCTV manufacturer - specifically for home and DIY CCTV
      users. It boasts some of the same advanced imaging technology as their commercial
      grade cameras, providing great picture quality and even better value for money.
      This system includes 2 HD bullet cameras and a digital video recorder. The cameras
      and DVR both use standard twist-fit BNC cables, so this is a great upgrade kit
      if you already have a legacy CCTV system installed.\r\n\r\nThe included cameras
      are IP66 rated, meaning they're completely weather proof and suitable for installation
      in exposed outdoor locations. Infrared LEDs also provide 20m clear night vision,
      for round-the-clock security even in totally unlit areas. They capture video
      at 1080p HD resolution, ensuring images full of usable subject detail. \r\n\r\nThe
      HiWatch DVR provides a host of features to let you automate your security, including
      adjustable motion detection and a 7 day, 24 hour schedule. Importantly, it has
      4 video channels, letting you easily expand the system with 2 additional cameras
      at a later date. The recorder can also connect to your network and, once configured,
      lets you remotely view your home on a PC or mobile device over the internet.
      Simply choose your desired hard drive storage from the drop down menu at the
      top of the page.\r\n"
