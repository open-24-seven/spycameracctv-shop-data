    description: "When setting up a home or business CCTV system, people often don't
      consider the risk of someone trying to damage the cameras. After all, even the
      highest resolution cameras on the market are of no use if someone's knocked
      them out of position. Luckily, this 2MP IP camera from Hikvision is housed in
      an IK10 rated, vandal proof dome. This completely encloses the camera, and is
      resistant to up to 20 joules of force, making it a great choice to install in
      those exposed locations such as points of entry, or narrow alleyways.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera itself is built around the same electronics as Hikvision's \"Darkfighter\"
      range of cameras, providing clear images even in dim or low light conditions.
      When even this is not enough, the camera is also fitted with IR LEDs to provide
      30m of night vision. Footage is recorded in 1920x1080 Full HD resolution, providing
      sharp subject detail around the clock. \r\n\r\nWhen connected to a <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spy/cctv-recorders/hd-ip-nvrs/\"
      target=\"_blank\">Hikvision NVR</a> over a network, the camera supports the
      latest range of smart detection features, including line crossing and intrusion.
      Power-over-ethernet also means it can draw power from the same connection, so
      there's no need for an additional mains supply. If you don't have a recorder,
      then an onboard MicroSD slot can be used to record short clips, controlled from
      your PC or phone. Alternatively, this can be used as an automatic backup in
      case the connection to your NVR goes down."
