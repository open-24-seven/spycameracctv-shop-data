    description: "Looking to put together a 1080p TVI HD system? Such high resolution
      cameras naturally need to be connected to cables that won't compromise their
      recording quality. Luckily, this 10m cable is made from RG59 cable, with a shielded
      Copper core, making it perfect for use with these kits, as well as Sony EFFIO
      systems.\r\n\r\nThe cable is pre-fitted with a BNC connector for video & RCA
      for audio, as well as a 2.1mm jack for DC power. This means you only have to
      run one cable out to your camera's location.\r\n\r\nWe also have these cables
      in 5m, 20m, 30m, 40m, 50m and 60m lengths, so you can be sure to find the right
      size for your installation."
