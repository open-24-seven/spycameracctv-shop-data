    description: "We are proud to offer this 8-bullet camera system from Hikvisionâ€™s
      latest Hiwatch IP range, providing excellent value, easy-to-install home security
      systems that don't compromise on quality. This 8-camera system records pin sharp
      video in 1080p Full HD. It's a smart choice for securing the family home.\r\n\r\nThe
      cameras provide night vision with a range of 30 metres, helping keep even large
      unlit spaces secure 24/7. They are built in rugged, IP67 rated weatherproof
      housings, allowing them to set up outdoors exposed to the elements. They're
      also each fitted with a wide-angle lens, capturing every subject within a 106Â°
      field of view. Thanks to Power over Ethernet you neednâ€™t worry about extra
      power supplies because the cameras can draw their power from the Ethernet cables.\r\n\r\nWe
      have included an 8-camera network video recorder (NVR) to control the recording
      and storage of footage. As with all our professional CCTV recorders, it's kitted
      out with a host of motion detection and scheduling modes. The recorder can work
      with hard drives up to 6TB in size, just select the amount of storage needed
      from the drop down menu. The recorder connects directly to your router and,
      once configured, enables remote and mobile access. This means you can check
      up on live or recorded footage from anywhere using a PC or mobile device."
