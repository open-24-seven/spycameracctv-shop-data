    description: "Covert security is one of the most difficult challenges to approach
      with CCTV. For example, if you want to catch an office thief red-handed, you
      need a camera that can remain completely concealed, without sacrificing any
      image quality. This HD low light pinhole camera is the ideal solution, cramming
      1080p recording and amazing low light sensitivity into the smallest camera body
      that we've ever sold - only 25x25mm!\r\n\r\nThe camera boasts a Sony EXMOR imaging
      chip, capable of recording in full colour down to 0.08Lux, and then switching
      to black & white and dropping the shutter speed to continue working in conditions
      as dark as 0.0008Lux. Images are captured in 1920x1080p Full HD, ensuring videos
      are packed with usable subject detail. The pinhole lens also allows the camera
      to record through gaps as narrow as 2mm, so the camera and cables can remain
      safely hidden away behind a shelf or drawer.\r\n\r\n4-in-1 technology allows
      compatibility with HD-TVI, HD-CVI, AHD and CVBS video equipment, so it can easily
      be added to most existing CCTV systems with a twist-fit BNC connector. The camera
      also includes a plug-in control to quickly adjust the on-screen menu, providing
      in depth options for settings such as white balance and back-light compensation."
