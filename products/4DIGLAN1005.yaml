    description: "Wireless CCTV is one of the best security options for anyone looking
      for an easy DIY install that they can get up and running with a minimum of fuss,
      and is especially useful for people in rental properties. This 4-camera wireless
      kit is a great example, featuring 1080p HD cameras, and an all-in-one touch
      screen monitor and recorder, so you don't need any costly or complex additional
      devices to protect your property.\r\n\r\nThe cameras themselves record in 1920x1080
      full HD, recording amazing levels of subject detail for a wireless device. They
      also feature built-in passive infrared (PIR) sensors, that detect a subject's
      body heat and use it to trigger recording with much more accuracy than traditional
      motion detection. IR LEDs also provide 10m night vision range, making them suitable
      for use outdoors in unlit areas such as gardens and driveways. Video and audio
      are transmitted to the monitor using digital wireless, providing a clean, secure
      signal with up to 100m range in direct line of sight.\r\n\r\nThe monitor itself
      is packed with features, including a high resolution 9\" touch screen for watching
      the cameras in glorious full colour. The built-in MicroSD card slot lets you
      record footage, with fully adjustable scheduling and motion detection modes.
      A lithium rechargeable battery also means you can pick up and move the screen
      around your home without losing coverage. By plugging the monitor into your
      router, you can also set up mobile access. The free Android and iOS app lets
      you view the cameras from anywhere on a phone or tablet, and even use two-way
      audio to talk to subjects from the cameras' integrated speakers. "
