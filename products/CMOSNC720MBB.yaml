    description: "For almost a decade now, our range of bird box and observation cameras
      have been helping families and schools get closer to the wildlife all around
      them. Now, we are proud to have teamed up with the folks at Riverside Woodcraft
      to create our own range of wooden bird boxes. This means that, for the first
      time, we can provide a complete kit, including the box and camera, as well as
      the cables and power supplies needed to get it up and running. It's perfect
      as a gift for bird lovers, or an educational project for a class.\r\n\r\nThe
      box is made from sturdy 21mm thick timber, making it much more sturdy than most
      of the other options on the market, perfect for a long term installation. It's
      been specially designed for use with our cameras, featuring a central mounting
      point, and air slots through which you can run the cable. What's more, it's
      built from FSC Mix timber, ensuring the wood is from sustainable sources.\r\n\r\nThe
      tiny camera sits right in the top of the box, using invisible infrared to capture
      700tvl images at all hours without disturbing the birds. We have also fitted
      the camera with a wide angle lens, so it can see everything that happens inside
      the box. We have included a 20m to both run power to the box and send video
      back. The RCA connections on the cable can either connect directly into the
      back of a television, or be connected to an HDMI cable using the included HDMI
      video adapter. This lets you easily view the camera on HD TVs and monitors."
