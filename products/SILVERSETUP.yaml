      with a network enabled DVR with up to 4 channels</li>\r\nâ€¢ Users with up to
      4 IP cameras</li>\r\n\r\n<strong>Who is this service not right for?</strong>\r\n\r\nâ€¢
      Users with more than 4 cameras and a recorder</li>\r\nâ€¢ Configuring smart
      features on Hikvision IP cameras</li>\r\nâ€¢ Users with systems that include
      Wifi bridges or 4G routers</li>\r\n\r\n<i>For these situations we recommend
      our gold & platinum support packages</i>\r\n\r\nNetwork enabled CCTV systems
      are an essential way for you to keep an eye on your home or property whilst
      away, but we'll be the first to admit that they can be confusing to set up for
      those without experience with networks or routers. That's why we have put together
      our complete support packages! This no hassle remote setup service takes away
      the fuss of configuring your 4 camera CCTV system for remote viewing on PC or
      mobile.\r\n\r\nAfter the initial setup, we can then start a simple Direct Debit
      subscription for continued remote access via a secure web address. This also
      provides you with free ongoing support in case the connection has to be reset.\r\n\r\nLogging
      in remotely to your computer, one of our expert technical team will completely
      configure your DVR, software and router for online viewing. We will also set
      up a web address of your choosing (subject to availability) through which you
      can log in to watch your camera live. The service takes around an hour, during
      which you can either get our support agent to talk you through it on the phone,
      or just leave them to it if you'd rather sit back with a brew. We do however,
      ask that you are available by your computer in case we need to check something.\r\n\r\nThe
      setup service can also configure your system for mobile access, letting you
      view your cameras live on iOS, Android or Windows smartphones (subject to compatibility).
      It also covers 12 months of ongoing remote support for any connection problems
      that might occur."
