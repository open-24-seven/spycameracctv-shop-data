    description: "Our <a href=\"https://www.green-feathers.co.uk\" title=\"Green Feathers\"
      target=\"_blank\">Green Feathers</a> team has almost of decade of experience
      providing specialist cameras for watching birds and other wildlife. Now we can
      proudly say that we have partnered with Riverside Woodcraft - foremost manufacturers
      of hand crafted bird houses - to provide our own bird houses, specially designed
      for use with cameras. This kit pairs the larger, de luxe bird box with our market
      leading Wifi bird box camera. It includes everything you need to get the box
      installed, and the camera up and running on your phone or tablet.\r\n\r\nThe
      box is hand made from sturdy 21mm thick wood, significantly thicker than most
      other boxes on the market. Purpose designed for use with our cameras, it features
      a central mounting point, as well as air vents through which you can run the
      power cable. The front of the box is removable, both allowing easy installation
      of the camera, and use by species such Robins that prefer an open-fronted nest.
      Importantly, it's made from FSC Mix certified timber from sustainable sources.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera is our flagship model, connecting to your home's Wifi network to let
      you view from anywhere using an Android or iOS device. The digital sensor records
      pin sharp video in 960p resolution, with true-to-life colour in daylight. When
      light levels are low, it uses invisible IR LEDs to keep recording without any
      glow that could distract the chicks. The camera has a MicroSD card slot, letting
      you easily record footage - and even set up motion detection - without needing
      to connect it to an external recorder. The only connection the camera needs
      is to mains power, using the included 20m cable. Our Daylight LED lamp simply
      connects into the camera's power supply and passes the rest of the power through
      to the camera, so you don't have to run a separate power cable."
