    description: "With staff theft accounting for <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/blog/5-reasons-cant-ignore-staff-theft\">up
      to a third of retail losses</a>, it is sometimes an inconvenient truth that
      businesses owners will have to discreetly keep an eye on employees. It can often
      be tricky however, to find a system with a good balance between high quality
      recording and easy concealment. Even most of the smallest cameras will still
      need to be connected to a chunky and obvious recorder. Luckily, this Hikvision
      covert spy camera kit is the ideal solution. As well as a tiny pinhole camera,
      the kit includes a compact recorder that features many of the same smart detection
      modes as Hikvision's larger professional grade IP cameras.\r\n\r\nThe camera
      itself boasts an advanced sensor capable of recording WDR (wide dynamic range)
      video. This means it can pick up extra detail in shadow and highlight areas,
      helping it keep recording usable images in tricky high contrast situations such
      as when facing a window. It can also switch to black and white when in low light
      situations, allowing it to record footage right down to 0.0003Lux. Video can
      be recorded at up to 1080p Full HD resolution, capturing plenty of subject detail.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera connects to the recorder using an included 8m extension cable, letting
      you easily conceal it nearby. Don't be fooled by its size - the recorder packs
      in a host of professional control features, including motion detection, scheduling
      and even smart features such as line crossing and intrusion detection. Footage
      is recorded to a MicroSD card slot, compatible with cards up to 128GB (not included).
      Crucially, the recorder can be connected to your router, allowing remote access
      via PC, mobile or tablet. The means you can securely log in and view live footage
      from the camera over the internet from anywhere in the world!\r\n\r\n"
