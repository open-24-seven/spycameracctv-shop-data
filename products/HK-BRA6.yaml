    description: "Adding a junction box to your Hikvision bullet camera helps protect
      the cable connectors from vandals and the elements. It's rated IP64 waterproof
      - more than enough to protect cables - and is ideal for mounting on the outside
      of a building.\r\n\r\nImportantly, it makes it so much easier to wire the camera,
      as it prevents you having to drill large holes in an exterior wall to feed through
      the IP camera connector. "
