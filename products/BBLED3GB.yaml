    description: "Bird box cameras are an incredibly popular way to watch wildlife
      in your garden, capturing amazing close up views of chicks as they hatch and
      grow. One common issue, however, is that the inside of the unlit box is too
      dark. Whilst bird box cameras get past this using night vision, this is always
      monochrome, so you can't see the full glory of the bird's feathers.\r\n\r\nThis
      small LED light is a great solution to this issue. You can install it inside
      of the box, where it provides just enough illumination for the camera to record
      without having to use night vision. Importantly, it has a built-in photometer,
      which cuts off the LEDs when the ambient light levels drop. This means the light
      is off at night time, so it won't disturb the sleep cycles of your feathered
      friends!"
