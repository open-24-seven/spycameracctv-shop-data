    description: "Many of our professional grade CCTV cameras use Sony's <strong>EFFIO-P</strong>
      imaging technology, enabling them to record  clear video even in situations
      with high contrast and challenging lighting conditions. This remote UTC controller
      is a great way to control these powerful features, allowing you to make in depth
      adjustments using the camera's OSD (\"on-screen display\") menu.\r\n\r\nThe
      controller works in-line, simply plugging in to the camera in front of the video
      cable. This means you can quickly connect the controller to configure your cameras,
      and then disconnect it. This is unlike other designs of UTC controller that
      are built into the camera cable, meaning you have to drill a large hole to feed
      it through during installation.\r\n\r\n"
