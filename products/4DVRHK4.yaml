    description: "Hikvision's Turbo HD range brings many of the professional grade
      features  - previously only found in IP camera systems - to plug and play coaxial
      CCTV. These include smart video analytics such as line crossing and intrusion
      detection, letting you add advanced levels of automation to recording without
      needing an in depth network configuration to get the cameras set up. This all
      makes this 4 channel DVR a powerful security tool, as well as a fantastic option
      for upgrading legacy CCTV systems. \r\n\r\nThe hybrid recorder is compatible
      with TVI, AHD, CVI and CVBS cameras, and supports up to 2 IP cameras. The DVR
      can even handle footage from different video systems on each channel, letting
      you upgrade cameras in a system one-by-one, or mix IP and analogue formats.
      Footage can be recorded at resolutions up to 8MP (4K), capturing far more subject
      detail than has ever previously been possible with a coaxial DVR. The recorder
      also has 4 separate audio inputs, letting you connect a microphone to each channel.\r\n\r\nCameras
      can be viewed live on a TV or monitor using standard HDMI or VGA connections.
      You can also hook to DVR up to your router, allowing secure remote access via
      Hikvision's PC or mobile app. The recorder's smart analytics can be configured
      through a PC, or using the DVR's built-in menu system when connected to a TV
      or monitor via HDMI. Triggering modes can be set up on a camera-by-camera basis,
      as well as traditional recording features such as motion detection and scheduling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
