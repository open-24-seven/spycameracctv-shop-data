    description: "Providing powerful imaging technology with advanced analytics, Hikvision's
      range of thermal cameras are some of the most powerful security and monitoring
      devices available today. They're perfectly suited to a wide range of applications,
      from perimeter security to industrial quality assurance.\r\n\r\nThe thermal
      imaging module works in the 8-14 micrometre range, capturing the heat emitted
      by objects ranging from freezing to boiling hot. As well as working the same
      day or night, this thermal spectrum is not affected by obstructions such as
      smoke and smog, providing a clear view when standard cameras would be completely
      obscured. The sensor captures a clear 384x288 resolution image, at 50 fps for
      smooth motion. A 10mm lens provides a tightly cropped 36 degree field of view.
      As with all of Hikvisoin's professional cameras, the housing is IP66 weatherproof
      and suitable for outdoor use. The camera also supports PoE, and can be used
      with all of Hikvision's range of NVRs.\r\n\r\nHikvision's advanced video analytics
      provide a wide range of automation options. Options such as line crossing, region
      enter/exit and intrusion detection are all fully customisable using Hikvision's
      PC app, letting you manually \"draw\" regions in the frame for the camera to
      monitor. There are also thermal-specific features, including fire detection,
      and custom temperature alarms, perfect for watching over industrial machinery.\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a
