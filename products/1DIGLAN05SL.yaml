    description: "Adding security lighting to your home is one of the single most
      effective visual deterrents against intruders or burglars. This simple kit includes
      a wireless camera with a built in security spotlight, pairing it with a touchscreen
      monitor & recorder, for an incredibly versatile home security system that can
      be up and running without a complex installation.\r\n\r\nThe powerful spotlight
      is triggered whenever the PIR sensor on the front of the camera detects a moving
      subject, illuminating the area with white light. The feature packed camera also
      boasts 1080p Full HD images, and infrared LEDs for 10m night vision when the
      spotlight isn't in use. It even has a built-in speaker, allowing you to talk
      back to subjects near the camera remotely from the screen or mobile app.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera's wireless signal is picked up by the included touchscreen monitor, letting
      you watch live pictures, or files recorded to the MicroSD card slot (card not
      included). A lithium rechargeable battery lets you easily pick the screen up
      and move it around your house. You can also connect the device to your router
      for mobile access, allowing you to watch and control the cameras from anywhere
      using your mobile or tablet.\r\n\r\n"
