    description: "Setting up a bird box camera is a fantastic way for any nature lover
      to get closer to the wildlife right in their garden. Thanks to our partners
      at Riverside Woodcraft, we are now able to offer our popular wireless bird box
      camera as part of a complete kit, including a wooden bird box, and everything
      you need to get it up and running. This makes it a great project for families,
      or a learning aid for schools.  \r\n\r\nThe kit is built around our most popular
      wireless camera. This tiny device can be installed inside the bird box, and
      captures clear video of everything inside thanks to it's night vision LEDs and
      wide angle lens. It can then transmit video over wireless to the receiver. This
      means that all you need to connect it to is a power supply, using the included
      10m cable. The camera can transmit up to 50m in direct line of sight, however
      solid obstructions such as walls will reduce this significantly.\r\n\r\nThe
      bird box itself is specially designed for use with our cameras, featuring a
      simple mounting point, and slots to easily run the cable. What's more, the box
      is hand made in the UK with FSC certified timber. Also included with the pack
      is an RCA to HDMI adapter, letting you easily connect the receiver's AV cables
      to any modern HD TV or monitor (HDMI cable not included). "
