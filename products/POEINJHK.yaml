    description: "Many larger PoE devices, such as Hikvision's high powered PTZ cameras,
      draw more power than is available with standard PoE connections. This injector
      connects to the mains, and sends power down the ethernet cable to your camera.\r\n\r\nThe
      injector supplies up to 60W, enough to power Hi-PoE devices such as long range
      PTZ domes."
    specification: "Power Output: 60W\r\nCompatibility: PoE, PoE+, Hi-PoE\r\nConnectors:
      Kettle lead, RJ45 in, RJ45 out"
