    description: "Any security system is only as strong as it's weakest link. Because
      of this it's always vital to make sure your CCTV cables are well protected from
      the elements, vandals, or anything else that might stop them from working. This
      compact enclosure completely covers the junctions between your cabling and the
      camera. The housing is IP66 rated, ensuring it can provide protection even in
      exposed outdoor locations.\r\n\r\nIt's large enough to work with either Cat6
      cables for IP cameras, or RG59 cables for HD-TVI models. To install, just push
      the cables through the side and screw them in securely to the holder, then clip
      the cover closed.\r\n"
