    description: "This Hikvision pan-tilt-zoom camera's large zoom and night vision
      range make it a fantastic way to monitor larger open spaces such as a car park
      or farm. The motorised base can be controlled using a recorder, or even your
      PC or smartphone, providing 360 degree coverage of your property right at your
      fingertips.\r\n\r\nThe camera is built around a 2mp sensor, recording 1080p
      Full HD video. This is combined with a 25x optical zoom lens, letting you focus
      on incredibly fine details on nearby subjects, or on subjects right on the other
      side of your property. A bank of powerful infrared LEDs illuminates everything
      up to 100m away, whilst the camera's Smart IR feature reduces the intensity
      for objects closer to the camera, keeping them clearly lit. \r\n\r\nWhen connected
      to a Hikvision NVR, the camera supports a wide range of smart features, including
      intrusion and line crossing detection. It also allows a wide range of automated
      movements, including up to 300 pre set camera positions, and 8 programmed patrols.
      The high speed tracking lets you easily follow subjects either using the onscreen
      camera controls, or with a <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/pan-tilt-zoom-joystick-controller-cctv-monitor-ptz-ip-cameras\"
      target=\"_blank\">hardware controller</a>. This all makes the camera a powerful
      security tool, whether set up as a standalone device, or adding flexible coverage
      to a larger system."
