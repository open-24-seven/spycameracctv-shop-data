    description: "AHD, HD-TVI, 960h, 4-in-1; the last few years have seen a huge number
      of new CCTV formats, and as a result making everything is compatible is a complete
      nightmare. Luckily, our new 16 channel hybrid CCTV DVR is designed to work with
      almost every format on the market- if it's got a BNC connector on it, then it
      should work.You can even connect cameras with different formats into different
      channels, and have them recording at the same time! This makes it a perfect
      option if you want to upgrade an existing security system, but don't want to
      replace all of the cameras.\r\n\r\nCompatible camera include Sony's Effio range
      and Hikvision's Turbo HD-TVI. Footage is recorded in pin sharp 1080p HD, with
      even higher resolutions possible if the frame rate is reduced. The recorder
      also boasts multiple channels of audio recording, as well as a full suite of
      motion detection and scheduled recording options. Footage is recorded to your
      choice of built-in hard drive.\r\n\r\nThe DVR's HDMI output provides an easy
      way to monitor your cameras on a TV or monitor. You can also connect the DVR
      directly to your router, enabling remote access. Once configured, this lets
      you view live or recorded footage from anywhere in the world, via a PC or mobile
      device. The recorder includes all the instructions needed to complete this,
      however if you're not familiar with networking don't fret- we also offer a remote
      setup service that can get it all up and running for you. Just add this from
      the drop down at the top of the page.\r\n\r\n"
