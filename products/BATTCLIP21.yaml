    description: "This Battery Adapter will let you use your pinhole, bird box or
      wireless CCTV camera for short periods of time without the need for a local
      power source. Simply attach a 9V PP3 battery to the clips and plug the DC Jack
      Connector into your Birdbox Camera, 2.4GHz Wireless Camera or Pinhole Camera.\r\n\r\n<b>Please
      note</b> your Camera must have a Female Jack-Type Connector with a 2.1mm inner
      pin diameter and a 5.5mm outer diameter. Please verify that your camera also
      accepts an 8 to 9 Volt power input.\r\n\r\nThe length of time to be expected
      from a 9V PP3 Battery is relative to the power consumption of your camera as
      well as the quality and capacity of your batteries. From our testing we have
      found the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Wireless Bird Box Cameras with Infrared
      are the most power-hungry and will typically consume a 9V PP3 battery in approximately
      2-3 hours. We recommend the use of Lithium batteries in this scenario.</li>\r\n<li>Wireless
      Pinhole Cameras with no Infrared are second on the scale of power consumption
      and will typically consume a 9V PP3 battery in around 4 hours.</li>\r\n<li>With
      a Wired Pinhole Camera with no Infra-Red you can expect a battery life of up
      to 8 hours.</li>\r\n</ul>"
