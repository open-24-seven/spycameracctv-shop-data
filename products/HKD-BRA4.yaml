    description: "If you're installing an IP camera on an outside wall, then we always
      recommend using a junction box to manage your cables. The IP64 rated housing
      will protect the connectors from vandals as well as the elements.\r\n\r\nAs
      an added bonus, it means you no longer have to drill a huge hole in the outside
      wall in order to feed through the ethernet connector, making wiring so much
      simpler."
