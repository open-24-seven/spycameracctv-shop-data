    description: "With their best selling <strong>Turbo HD</strong> range, Hikvision
      have developed plug-and-play coaxial cameras that feature amazing image quality
      and features previously only possible with IP systems. This compact dome camera
      is no exception, boasting 8MP (3840x2160) video recording. This makes it possible
      to pull faces or clothing detail from crowds, and is ideally suited to retail
      or venue security systems.\r\n\r\nThe advanced imaging sensor also allows the
      camera to keep recording in full colour in conditions as dark as 0.003 lux,
      letting you record for longer without needing to switch the infra red. 120dB
      Wide Dynamic Range also helps keep subject detail in tricky high contrast situations,
      such as in front of a window or door. When paired with <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/hikvision-turbo-hd-4-channel-dvr-8mp-recording\"
      target=\"_blank\">Hikvision's Turbo HD DVR</a>, you can even set up line crossing
      and intrusion detection, for highly adjustable recording triggers.\r\n\r\nAfter
      dark, EXIR LEDs provide 40m night vision, whilst automatically adjusting for
      close-in subjects. The 2.8mm lens allows a 102 degree wide field of view, ideally
      suited to interior spaces. All of this is protected inside of an IP67 rated
      weather proof dome, suitable for outdoor use. It's also IK10 vandal proof, allowing
      installation in exposed areas without risk of damage.\r\n\r\n"
