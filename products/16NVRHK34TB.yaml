    description: "When you've invested money in the best 4K CCTV cameras on the market,
      it's important to use a recorder that can manage the demands of such high resolution
      footage. This commercial quality 16 camera HIkvision NVR is an ideal choice.
      It has 256Mbps of bandwidth, providing enough processing grunt to handle four
      8 megapixel cameras at the same time - or 16 2MP cameras. This makes it a great
      choice for properties that require extensive coverage, or systems with a mix
      of different types, such as car parks.\r\n\r\nThe recorder uses a built-in 16
      port Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) switch to send power to the cameras down the
      network cable, helping prevent the need for extra power supplies and keep installation
      simple. It ships with a 4TB hard drive built in as standard, but has four internal
      hard drive bays, allowing it to be upgraded to up to 24TB if required. \r\n\r\nAs
      you'd expect with one of HIkvision's professional NVRs, it's kitted out with
      the best automation features on the market. These not only include motion detection
      and scheduling, but compatibility with the most recent camera's behavioural
      analytics settings such as line crossing, object removal, intrusion and face
      detection. All of these can be set directly on the recorder using a monitor,
      or remotely via HIkvision's PC app. Live & recorded footage can also be viewed
      ont he go via iOS or Android devices."
