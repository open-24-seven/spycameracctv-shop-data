    description: "8 megapixel video - or 4k - is the flagship resolution for CCTV,
      recording images with <i>four times</i> the subject detail of Full HD. This
      makes it unmatched for picking subjects out of large areas such as crowds or
      car parks, or for recording fine details like faces & license plates. Up until
      now this has meant investing in a complex IP camera system that needs an in
      depth network setup. Hikvision's Turbo HD range, however, can now provide fully
      fledged 8 megapixel CCTV, using standard plug-and-play BNC cables. \r\n\r\nThis
      CCTV system includes 2 dome cameras from this range, as well as a professional
      grade recorder to control and monitor them. Each camera is housed inside of
      a vandal proof, weather proof dome, allowing it to be installed in exposed locations
      either indoors or outdoors. Their discreet shape make them especially popular
      for shops & bars. Powerful IR illuminators provide 40m night vision for use
      in large unlit areas. \r\n\r\nThe recorder is also part of Hikvisions's Turbo
      HD range, ensuring it can capture video from the cameras without any loss in
      resolution. It features 4 video channels, letting you easily expand the system
      with up to 2 more cameras at a later date. A network connection also lets you
      plug the DVR into your router in order to configure remote access from PC, mobile
      or tablet. You can use this to not only view footage from the cameras, but adjust
      the DVR's in depth recording features such as scheduling and motion detection."
