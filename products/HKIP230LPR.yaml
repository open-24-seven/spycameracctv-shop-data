    description: "Unleash the power of Hikvision's Darkfighter cameras, which feature
      is Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology allowing the cameras
      to capture vehicles' registration plates and send the key data to a Smart NVR.
      These cameras are designed for the outdoors and are IP67 rated meaning that
      they are fully encased from water and dust. With advanced optics and sensor
      electronics the Darkfighters are suited bright, sunlit environments where subjects
      may be lit from behind. Ordinarily for cameras with auto-exposure back-lit subjects
      are underexposed as the camera compensates with the bright sun leading to silhouetted
      subjects. The Darkfighter cameras overcome this with wide dynamic range (WDR)
      and smart imaging technology to ensure that the subject is always properly exposed
      and focussed. \r\n\r\nBased on IP technology the cameras send Full 1080p HD
      images with a frame rate of up to 50 fps over network cable with Power over
      Ethernet (PoE). The camera also boasts other professional attributes such as
      a vari-focal lens with motorised zooming and 50m infra-red night vision. Additionally,
      the camera can record footage using its integrated MicroSD card slot. Cards
      of up to 128GB in capacity are supported allowing for plenty of storage space.
