    description: "All too often, setting up a covert CCTV system means having to compromise
      on picture resolution. This is a big problem in many scenarios, for example
      if you're trying to set up a camera to watch what staff are doing at the till.
      Luckily, this tiny pinhole camera provides an ideal solution, boasting an incredible
      recording resolution of 5 megapixels, despite measuring a tiny 25x25mm.\r\n\r\nThe
      advanced imaging sensor records video at up to 2688x1920, capturing over twice
      the picture detail of Full HD. The resolution can also be dropped down to 4MP
      if widescreen video is required. All of this is recorded through a tiny pinhole
      lens, capable of seeing through gaps as small as 2mm. This allows you to keep
      the camera itself neatly concealed, for example in a drawer or at the back of
      a shelf.\r\n\r\nThe camera's 3-in-1 technology means it's compatible with HD-TVI,
      AHD and CVBS video systems. In other words, it should be backwards compatible
      with most legacy CCTV systems, and is a great option for expanding an existing
      kit. We have also included a plug-in control for the camera's on-screen display,
      letting you quickly change settings such as white balance and back-light compensation."
