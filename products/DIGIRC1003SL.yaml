    description: "This digital wireless security camera is a fantastic addition to
      our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/720p-hd-digital-wireless-cctv-kit-mobile-access-9-portable-lcd\">Portable
      LCD receiver kit</a>, allowing you to add extra coverage to your system. Uniquely,
      this camera features a powerful built-in security light. This uses ultra-bright
      daylight LEDs to illuminate a wide area in front of the camera whenever the
      system detects movement. The brightness and triggering can be adjusted from
      the system's control menu.\r\n\r\nAs with the other cameras available for the
      system, this camera uses digital wireless transmission in order to send video
      back to the receiver. This system helps boost the signal's range, allowing it
      to transmit up to 100m in direct line of sight, and also helps greatly reduce
      interference from other wireless devices.\r\n\r\nThe camera records in 720p
      high definition- incredibly high quality for a wireless camera. This helps it
      capture plenty of usable details of subjects. Other features include an IP66
      weather resistant housing to allow outdoor use, IR night vision, and even a
      built-in PIR motion detector."
