    description: "Our standard <a href=\\\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/cctv_security_camera_inline_audio_microphone\\\"
      target=\\\"new\\\">CCTV microphones</a> are a great way to discreetly record
      audio with your video footage, however they are not designed for sensitive subjects,
      and have a small effective range. Because of this, we have designed this new
      model that includes a built-in preamp, greatly boosting the microphone\\'s recording
      sensitivity. This makes it perfect for monitoring subjects in quiet interior
      locations.\r\n\r\nThe microphone uses in-line power, allowing you to connect
      it to the same power supply as a CCTV camera, with both devices running from
      one plug. This makes it easy to integrate into a security system, and the RCA
      phono cable can be plugged directly into the back of most DVRs."
