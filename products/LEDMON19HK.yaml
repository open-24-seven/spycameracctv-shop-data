    description: "This compact 19\" CCTV monitor from Hikvision is a fantastic solution
      for viewing live camera footage in a back office or stock room. The backlit
      colour LED display ensures a clear & bright image, with enough detail to watch
      1MP or 720p HD cameras without any loss in quality. \r\n\r\nThe monitor features
      VGA and HDMI inputs, allowing it to work with any of our CCTV DVRs & NVRs without
      needing any configuration - just plug it in and ou're good to go! Whilst the
      screen is designed for use with security systems, the HDMI connection means
      it can also be used for anything from PCs to video game consoles."
