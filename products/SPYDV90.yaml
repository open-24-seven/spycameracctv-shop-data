    description: "Our tiny spy pinhole camera recorder is an ideal device for covert
      security surveillance in the home, office settings or in your car. With its
      covert form factor this device can be placed in a room without attracting any
      attention from unsuspecting passers-by. Key to its genius is the fact it is
      battery-powered and features MicroSD card recording meaning that no external
      recorders or wiring is required. \r\n\r\nThe integrated rechargeable Lithium-ion
      battery provides up to 4 hours battery life on constant recording or up to 500
      hours when the device is set to sound-trigger mode. Plenty of recording storage
      is provided due to the MicroSD slot, which supports cards up to 32GB in capacity.
      Simply pop the MicroSD card (not included) into your computer or use the USB
      cable to watch back videos at a later date.\r\n\r\n"
