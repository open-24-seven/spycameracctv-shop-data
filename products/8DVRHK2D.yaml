    description: "We often talk to customers who have a large CCTV system, but want
      to upgrade one or two key cameras. Previously having different types of camera
      in a system would cause compatibility issues, however this 8 channel Hybrid
      CCTV recorder from Hikvision is the perfect solution. It can work with everything
      from traditional analogue cameras to their latest generation of Turbo HD 4.0
      HD-TVI equipment, recording at up to 5MP resolution. It even has inputs for
      up to two 6MP IP, letting you easily combine digital and analogue security technologies.\r\n\r\nAs
      with all of our professional CCTV DVRs, it features a full suite of customisable
      recording modes, including motion detection, 7 day scheduling and via alarm
      triggers, all adjustable on a camera-by-camera basis. Other advanced features
      include audio input for a microphone, RS485 terminals for a PTZ cotroller, and
      VGA & HDMI outputs to easily connect it to a TV or Monitor. Uniquely, the recorder
      also supports Hikvision's new Power-over-Coax technology. This lets you power
      compatible Turbo HD cameras directly from the RG59 cable, removing the need
      for additional power supplies.\r\n\r\nAs is befitting such a state of the art
      CCTV recorder, a LAN connection allows you to plug it directly into your internet
      router. Once this is configured this lets you view live footage, play back recordings
      and even adjust recording settings via a secure online interface using a PC
      or Mac. You can even log in and view footage using a smartphone or tablet, with
      Android, iOS and Windows devices supported. The kit includes all the required
      instructions to complete this yourself, but if you don't fancy the hassle then
      you can always let one of of our support agents do it all for you with our remote
      set up service. This also provides ongoing support in case of software issues-
