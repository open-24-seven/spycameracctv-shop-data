    description: "<strong>Who is this service right for?</strong>\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Users
      with large systems using more than 8 cameras</li>\r\nâ€¢ Commercial users with
      multiple smart IP cameras</li>\r\nâ€¢ Users whose CCTV coverage is critical
      for their business</li>\r\nâ€¢ Larger systems using Wifi bridges and 4G routers</li>\r\n\r\nIP
      camera systems provide previously unheard of levels of automation and control,
      but this goes hand in hand with a configuration process that can be much more
      involved and complex. We also know that many business users who need larger
      security systems - more than 8 cameras - can't afford to spend setting this
      up themselves. Because of this, we have put together this remote support package,
      providing an initial configuration and ongoing coverage, all in one complete
      service.\r\n\r\nBy logging remotely into your network, our UK based helpdesk
      team can completely configure your recorder and network for remote access, letting
      you watch live or recorded footage from PC, phone or tablet. They can set up
      the DVR or NVR, programming time & date, motion detection and scheduling settings,
      and also setting up a unique web address through which you can securely access
      the recorder. If you have Hikvision IP cameras, then they can also set up smart
      features such as line crossing and intrusion detection. The process takes around
      an hour, during which time you can either get our helpdesk team to walk you
      through the process, or just relax with a cuppa. We do however recommend that
      you stay available by a computer throughout the process.\r\n\r\nAfter the initial
      setup, there is a Direct Debit subscription for ongoing support. This includes
      resetting remote access should the connection go down and an annual check to
      make sure it's all working properly. This professional level of support even
      includes free on-site replacements should an item develop a fault, so you have
      peace of mind that essential coverage is not lost.\r\n\r\n"
