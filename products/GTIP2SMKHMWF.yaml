    description: "Sitting discreetly on a ceiling, this unassuming home smoke detector
      hides a surprise - a professional quality 1080p IP camera. Wifi connectivity
      means you can log in and securely watch footage from a PC or mobile device,
      all without needing any suspicious trailing network cables. Crucially, the camera
      features a MicroSD slot, so doesn't need to be connected to any exterior devices
      to record footage, making it an incredibly versatile standalone solution for
      home security.\r\n\r\nNestled inside the housing, the camera captures footage
      in 1920x1080p Full HD, providing full colour images packed with identifying
      details. A tiny pinhole lens on the side of the casing allows the lens to look
      down, recording everything in a 72 degree field of view, and recording in conditions
      as dark as 0.5 lux. The camera is even compatible with external IR illuminators,
      providing an option for monitoring totally unlit areas.\r\n\r\nThe IP camera
      connects to your internet via the router, letting you log in and view live or
      recorded footage from anywhere. The device needs to be initally plugged in to
      the router for a one-time configuration process, but after that works over Wifi.
      The MicroSD slot lets you easily record footage directly to the device, all
      controlled using the app. There are even options for motion detection and scheduling,
      which would usually need an external recorder. Compatible with cards up to 128GB
      in size, not included."
