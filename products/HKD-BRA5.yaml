    description: "When installing IP cameras on an exterior wall, we always recommend
      using a junction box. This Hikvision junction box is designed for use with their
      smaller dome cameras, and provides protection for the camera's connectors. It
      is made to IP64 standard, with more than enough weather proofing for wiring.\r\n\r\nThe
      box makes wiring so much simpler, as you no longer need to drill a large hole
      in the exterior wall in order to feed through the ethernet connector.\r\n"
