    description: "Power-over-Ethernet - or PoE - devices let you run power down a
      network cable to IP cameras, preventing the need for a dedicated mains power
      supply. PoE makes it much simpler to wire up large IP security systems, but
      comes with a drawback - it only works down cables up to 90m in length. This
      long range PoE extender is a great solution, increasing this range by further
      100m. You can even chain multiple extenders together, sending the power down
      a total cable length of 500m.\r\n\r\nThe extenders work with standard Cat5e
      or Cat6 cable using RJ45 connectors. They are housed in sturdy metal casings,
      and feature built in brackets for wall mounting."
