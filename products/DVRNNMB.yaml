    description: "Over the years, we've often been approached by customers who are
      dealing with abuse, or even vandalism, by their neighbours. In these cases,
      it can be tricky to get evidence on video, as installing a visible camera on
      your property could potentially inflame conflicts. Luckily, this outdoor spy
      camera kit is an ideal solution. It features our smallest weatherproof camera,
      as well as an HD recorder that can be left running inside your home. \r\n\r\nThe
      camera is tiny - about the same size as a lipstick - but still captures video
      at 1080p Full HD resolution. Crucially, it doesn't use infra-red, so there is
      no tell-tale glow to attract attention. Despite this, it can still work in light
      levels as low as 0.0008 lux. The Sony imaging chip records in full colour in
      daylight, before switching to black and white to boost sensitivity.\r\n\r\nThe
      included DVR provides a wide range of recording settings, including fully adjustable
      motion detection and scheduling. As well as your choice of hard drive, it features
      4 video channels. This lets you easily add additional cameras if you want to
      expand your kit at a later date. You can also set watch your camera and adjust
      settings from a PC or mobile device by connecting the recorder to your router
      (configuration required).\r\n"
