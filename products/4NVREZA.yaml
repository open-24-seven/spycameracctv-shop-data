    description: "Hikvision's best-selling HiWatch range provides easy to use security
      solutions, perfect for DIY installers. As part of this range, this 4 channel
      network video recorder (NVR) features high resolution recording and advanced
      features, along with a simple, compact design. It's a great value option for
      setting up an IP security system in your home, or in a small shop.\r\n\r\nThe
      recorder can capture footage from up to 4 cameras, and record in resolutions
      up to 4MP (2560x1440), ensuring you won't lose any picture quality from your
      cameras. It also supports a wide range of Hikvision's smart detection features,
      and features a smart search mode, to easily check footage for important events
      and triggers. The four camera inputs also support PoE, sending power down the
      cable to run compatible cameras without additional mains supplies. The recorder
      can be pre-fitted with hard drives up to 6TB in size, simply select the required
      hard drive from the drop down menu.\r\n\r\nBy connecting the NVR to your internet
      router, you can also allow remote access. Once configured, this lets you watch
      live or recorded footage from anywhere using a PC or mobile app. HDMI and VGA
      outputs also allow you to easily connect the recorder to an HD TV or monitor.\r\n"
