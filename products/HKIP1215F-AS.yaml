    description: "Planning the location of cameras is one of the most tricky parts
      of purchasing a security system - do they focus on high traffic areas like doorways,
      or get it all in a wide field of view? By capturing a complete 360 degree field
      of view with a huge 12MP resolution, this Hikvision fisheye IP camera makes
      the entire argument redundant. It's a perfect solution for large spaces with
      multiple areas of interest, all without the size and complexity of a pan-tilt-zoom
      camera.\r\n\r\nThe camera is built around a massive 4000x3072 sensor, fitted
      with a circular fisheye lens. When mounted on the ceiling, this captures everything
      that is happening below the camera in incredibly high detail. When used with
      Hikvision's IVMS software, you can choose from a range of viewing modes, including
      panoramic, and up to 4 simultaneous regions regions of interest. That's like
      having 4 PTZ cameras in one location! It's a perfect solution for sites such
      as warehouses or open plan offices. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the advanced imaging
      functions, the camera also boasts IR LEDs for 15m of night vision range in every
      direction. A microphone and small speaker also provides 2 way audio, letting
      you listen to subjects as well as talking back through the camera. The camera
      housing is also IP66 rated, allowing installation indoors or outdoors."
