    description: "Until now if you wanted to get full quality HD images from your
      security system the only real option was setting up IP cameras on a network.
      Some of us more techy types find tweaking around with IP addresses and network
      settings fun, however most people would rather just plug in some cable and get
      going, especially in a large commercial set-up where simplicity and ease of
      use is important.\r\n\r\nTurbo HD TVI technology allows the sending of uncompressed
      1080p full quality video over the standard coax cable used in most CCTV systems.
      This can give you the ability to upgrade your existing analogue system to super
      high quality cameras and DVRs without needing to tear out your existing cabling
      infrastructure and put in a new one. It even supports Power-over-Coax (PoC),
      letting it draw power from a compatible DVR over the RG59 cable, and removing
      the need for an additional power supply.\r\n\r\nAs well as extremely detailed
      and clear images and zero delay playback giving you truly live surveillance,
      this camera is packed with features making it versatile enough for almost any
      security application. To give you true accuracy and flexibility of coverage,
      the camera features a motorised lens, allowing you to zoom in from 92 to 32
      degrees remotely using your DVR, or with a <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/inline-remote-utc-controller-effio-p-cameras-osd-menus\">UTC
      Controller</a>. The camera also boasts 40 metres of night vision capability
      using Hikvision's EXIR Infra-red technology for more even and reliable low light
      images. Bi-directional communication with the camera also gives more options
      for precise control, allowing access to wide dynamic range and image controls.\r\n\r\nThis
      camera packs all the features needed for a professional security system while
      giving you plenty of options for flexibility. It is also ideal for upgrading
      an existing system to high quality HD without rewiring your existing set-up
      or needing to set up IP cameras on a network.  \r\n\r\nYou don't have to take
      our word for it though, check out our comparison video to really see how much
      better your security footage could be with a Turbo HD TVI system."
