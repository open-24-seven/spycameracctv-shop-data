    description: "Don't be fooled by it's size - this absolutely tiny spy camera packs
      a lithium rechargeable battery, as well as a host of detection methods to trigger
      recording. This all makes it an incredibly versatile tool for a wide range of
      security applications including preventing stock room theft, securing your parked
      car, or monitoring elderly relatives' care.\r\n\r\nThe video recorder uses a
      tiny pinhole lens, capable of recording through gaps as small as 3mm. This means
      the camera itself can remain safely out view on a shelf of in a drawer. As well
      as continuous recording, the camera can be set to use <strong>motion detection</strong>
      to trigger whenever there is movement in front of the lens, or <strong>voice
      triggering</strong> to start recording based on sound. For extended monitoring,
      you can also use the low power <strong>vibration detection</strong> mode, letting
      the camera sit on standby for up to 15 days on a full charge.\r\n\r\n<i>To allow
      the camera to be as small as possible, all custom settings and triggering modes
      are controlled by the free software, just connect the camera via USB to a computer
      to configure the settings before use.</i>\r\n\r\nThis spy camera also features
      bluetooth control, letting you use a free iOS or Android app to remotely start
      and stop recording from up to 80m away. This lets you easily check the recorder's
      status without giving away the location. Footage is recorded to the built-in
      MicroSD card slot, compatible with cards up to 256GB (not included), holding
      up to 64 hours of footage at the highest quality setting.\r\n\r\n"
