    description: "Ubiquiti is one of the largest names in Wireless networking, providing
      a wide range of specialist devices to improve your network's coverage and speed.
      This pair of Nanobeam ac WiFi bridges can across distances over 1km, with incredible
      speeds. This makes them a perfect solution to transmit data from IP cameras
      across large properties such as farms.\r\n\r\nThe two devices need to be set
      up facing each with direct line of sight, using the included pole mount bracket.
      The innovative ball and socket design makes lining them up a breeze. Just use
      ethernet cables to connect one bridge to your IP camera, and the other to your
      router. You can even connect multiple devices to the unit using a network switch."
