    description: "This USB power bank may look mundane, but it conceals a secret -
      a Full HD Wifi spy camera, recording from a tiny pinhole lens in the side of
      the device. It's generic design means it can be left out in the open on a desk
      or shelf without gaining any unwanted attention. Not only that, but it also
      works as a functional power bank for 5V devices, so it won't attract any suspicion
      if your subjects try it out. \r\n\r\nThe camera records time & date stamped
      video in 1080p Full HD, ideally suited to gathering evidence. The large Lithium
      battery powers the camera, providing over 8 hours of continuous recording time.
      The kit includes a 16GB MicroSD to store footage, although the recorder does
      work with cards up to 32GB. A built-in Wifi connection means you can connect
      to view and control the camera using a phone or tablet, and even connect remotely
      from anywhere in the world. "
