    description: "Hikvision have designed this HiWatch 4 channel CCTV DVR specifically
      for home security, with many of the same recording options as their professional
      recorders, but without the bulky size and price tag to match. It records footage
      from up to 4 cameras in HD quality, and can be set up with a host of scheduling
      options.\r\n\r\nThe hybrid recorder uses 4-in-1 technology to work with almost
      all CCTV cameras that use the standard twist-fit BNC connector, so it will be
      compatible both with new HD cameras and legacy equipment that you may already
      have installed. When used with 720p cameras, a special long distance transmission
      setting allows it to work with cabling up to 1200m in length, so large properties
      aren't a problem either. It can even support up to 5 IP cameras recording at
      960p resolution.\r\n\r\n With compatible cameras, you can also enable H.264+
      encoding, which increases recording times without losing quality. You can connect
      the recorder directly to an HD monitor either using VGA or HDMI, or alternatively
      connect it to your network. Once configured, this lets you easily access live
      or recorded footage from anywhere using a PC, phone or tablet."
