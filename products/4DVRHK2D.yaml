    description: "We often talk to existing CCTV system users who want to take advantage
      of the huge leap in quality that comes with upgrading to HD cameras, but are
      concerned about the extra complexity of moving to an IP camera system. This
      4 channel <strong>Turbo HD TVI</strong> DVR from Hikvision is the perfect answer
      to those questions, providing highly detailed video recordings whilst still
      keeping the plug and play simplicity and backwards compatibility of a traditional
      CCTV DVR.\r\n\r\nTurbo HD TVI is a format from Hikvision that allows the recorder
      to capture amazing video at above-HD resolutions from cameras using a standard
      coaxial cable with BNC connectors. When used with Turbo HD TVI cameras this
      ensures huge amounts of detail are recorded, for footage that meets the most
      exacting commercial security requirements, with 5MP video recorded independently
      from each camera. As it's compatible with traditional analogue CCTV and cables,
      this means you can upgrade your security system bit-by-bit, replacing individual
      cameras rather than stumping for a complete system in one go. It even supports
      up to two 6MP IP cameras, letting you easily combine digital and analogue formats
      with one recorder.\r\n\r\nThe recorder supports a full range of motion detection
      & scheduling modes, as well as Hikvision's own smart features. These include
      line crossing and intrusion detection, providing an extra level of automation
      control for your recording. Audio inputs also allow you to run CCTV microphones
      next to your cameras, providing sound monitoring as well as video. The recorder
      also has VGA and HDMI outputs, providing an easy way to connect it to a TV or
      monitor to view your cameras. Uniquely, the recorder supports Hikvison's Power-over-Coax
      technology, powering compatible Turbo HD cameras over the RG59 cable, and removing
      the need for separate power supplies.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our CCTV recorders,
      it also features an ethernet plug, to easily connect the recorder to your network.
      Once configured, this allows you to watch live or recorded footage from anywhere
      in the world via a PC or mobile device. Hikvision's software even provides in
      depth control of recording settings via a secure PC interface."
