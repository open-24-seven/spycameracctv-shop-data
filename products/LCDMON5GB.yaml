    description: "This compact 5\" mini CCTV monitor is a quick and easy way to view
      live footage from any of our Green Feathers 700TVL bird box cameras. It's a
      perfect solution if you are unable to set up a TV near the wireless receiver
      in your home, or if the cable is too short to run to your TV.\r\n\r\nThe screen
      uses a TFT LCD to display a bright, full colour picture at 800x480 resolution.
      It's really simple to set up, using standard plug-and-play RCA connectors. It
      has 2 inputs, letting you switch between sources, and even includes suction
      and adhesive mounts, so you can quickly install it on anything from a window
      to a desk."
