    description: "Hikvision's Turbo HD-TVI range is an incredibly popular combination
      of high resolution images and a simple plug-and-play setup. This 40m bullet
      camera is part of the latest generation of TVI gear, capturing huge 5 megapixel
      (2592x1944) video images, packed with fine detail. The result is a professional
      grade camera that can compare with all but the most advanced IP cameras, all
      without the hassle of configuring it to your network.\r\n\r\nIt's not just the
      resolution that's impressive, either - the camera also features 40m of night
      vision, making it suitable for monitoring larger unlit areas round the clock.
      The camera uses Hikvision's advanced EXIR LEDs, helping provide uniform and
      clear illumination right across the image. The bullet camera is also protected
      by an IP67 rated housing, providing complete protection from the elements. This
      makes it a perfect option for security in an outdoor area. Image settings such
      as contrast and backlight correction can also be adjusted using the built-in
      menu system, ensuring you have precise control over the image.\r\n\r\nThe camera
      uses a standard twist-fit BNC output, so can plug straight in to any HD-TVI
      compatible recorder. It even supports Power-over-Coax (PoC), letting it draw
      power from a compatible DVR over the RG59 cable, and removing the need for an
      additional power supply. "
