    description: "This 1080p Pan Tilt WiFi IP camera is the latest model from Foscam,
      one of the most trusted names in remote and home surveillance. As with all of
      Foscam's cameras, it has been designed from the ground up for ease of use and
      quick installation. All you have to do is install the app, then use your phone
      to scan the code on the bottom of the camera and follow a few onscreen prompts.
      After this you will be able to remotely view live footage and recordings using
      your phone, and even control the camera's movements on its motorised base. This
      all makes it a fantastic choice for home security, even for those unfamiliar
      with CCTV or IP cameras. Use it for monitoring pets, checking for intruders
      while on holiday, or as a nanny camera.\r\n\r\nThe camera itself is fitted with
      a high-resolution colour sensor, letting it record crisp video in 1920x1080
      HD. Coupled with the wide angle lens, this provides plenty of detail, letting
      you get the best view of what is happening in your home. the camera is also
      fitted with IR LEDs, providing 7m of night vision illumination. This is more
      than enough for even a large room in a house, and ensures you can see what is
      going on 24/7.\r\n\r\nIn addition to viewing live footage via the mobile app,
      you can also log in to securely view using a PC. Footage can be recorded and
      stored directly to the built-in MicroSD card slot (card not included)."
