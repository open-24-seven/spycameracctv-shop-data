    description: "This Hikvision turret IP camera is part of their specialist Darkfighter
      range, Featuring an advanced imaging chip sensitive to ultra low light conditions.
      This makes it one of our best options for monitoring unlit indoor areas, or
      open outdoor properties at night. The sensor can record in light levels as low
      as 0.005 lux - equivalent to a moonless night - without needing to turn on its
      night vision LEDs. This means it can record in colour for longer, and there
      will be significantly less noise or grain in the images. \r\n\r\nAs part of
      the latest range of HIkvision IP cameras, it also boasts their advanced behavioural
      analytics, a host of triggering and control options that can be set using a
      Hikvision NVR or PC software. Options include triggering the camera whenever
      a subject crosses a predetermined line on the screen, or automatic recording
      of faces as the move past the camera. They provide previously unheard of flexibility
      for automation, and help make monitoring your property easier than ever before.\r\n\r\nOther
      professional grade features include an IP67 rated weatherproof housing to protect
      the camera, and 30m of night vision illumination for situations that are too
      dark even for the advanced sensor. The camera uses Power over Ethernet to draw
      power from the network cable, so you don't need to use an additional power supply.
      It also includes an on-board MicroSD card slot, letting you store footage without
      using an external recorder."
