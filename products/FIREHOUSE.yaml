    description: "This heavy duty housing is rated to protect box CCTV cameras from
      damage caused by explosions, fire and the elements. It's made from solid Aluminium
      alloy, and is completely sealed with 12mm thick flanges. The camera records
      through a glass window, with a built-in heater preventing fogging that might
      reduce visibility. This makes it an ideal piece of kit for monitoring high risk
      areas like oil & gas installations or refineries.\r\n\r\nWe can provide box
      cameras to fit this housing as a special order on short notice. Just get in
      touch with us on 0117 325 2470 (then select menu option 4) and we can find the
      right solution for you!"
