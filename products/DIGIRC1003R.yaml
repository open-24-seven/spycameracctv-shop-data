    description: "<strong>B-grade product: 20% off</strong>\r\nThis item is likely
      a customer return or an ex-display model that is in a good condition but may
      have some light cosmetic damage. \r\n\r\nThis digital wireless CCTV camera is
      an ideal addition for our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/720p-hd-digital-wireless-cctv-kit-mobile-access-9-portable-lcd\"
      target=\"new\">portable LCD recorder security systems</a>, allowing you to expand
      your system up to a maximum of 4 cameras all independently working with the
      same recorder. The system can support up to 2 cameras recording at 720p HD quality,
      or 4 cameras recording at VGA quality.\r\n\r\nUniquely for a wireless camera,
      it is capable of recording footage at 1280x720 HD, a significant improvement
      over most other models available on the market, and helping record the most
      detail possible in your security videos. After dark, a ring of IR LEDs help
      illuminate subjects up to 10m away, even in complete darkness. The camera is
      even kitted out with a PIR sensor, allowing it to use a subject's body heat
      to trigger motion detection recording. This is all housed inside a durable weatherproof
      plastic casing, letting you use it in exposed outdoor locations.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera's built-in digital wireless transmitter pairs with the receiver for a
      clean and secure signal, allowing it to work up to 100m away, although solid
      obstructions will reduce this significantly. As with all wireless cameras, you
      will still need to connect it to a power supply, however, the built in 3m power
      cable gives you freedom to move it around, and we also have extension cables
      up to 20m in length if required (see drop down menu at top of page)."
