    description: "Hikvision has pioneered the field of thermal imaging, providing
      groundbreaking security technology at prices that simply wouldn't have been
      possible 5 years ago. This bi-spectrum bullet camera is a great example, combining
      a highly sensitive thermal module with a 2MP visual spectrum IP camera. This
      provides a versatile device that provides clear real-colour footage in good
      light, and still easily pick out subjects when the view is obscured by vegetation
      or smog. Because of this, it's one of the best cameras on the market for perimeter
      security and intrusion detection.\r\n\r\nThe thermal module captures the heat
      emitted by any subject within a 33 degree field of view, creating a 160x120
      image. This is useful by itself for monitoring, but when combined with Hikvision's
      range of analytics features it truly comes into it's own. These include intrusion,
      line crossing, and region entrance/exit detection, all set to custom zones that
      can be added to the image using in Hikvision's PC app. Other unique features
      include fire detection, and a temperature alarm, that can be used to trigger
      an alert when a region rises above a set level - perfect for industrial QA and
      safety monitoring.\r\n\r\nThe camera can be manually switched between thermal
      and HD visual modes, or combine them using an innovative Image Fusion overlay.
      \ The camera itself supports Power-over-Ethernet, and includes a MicroSD card
      slot for recording footage without an NVR, or to use as an emergency automated
      backup. A durable IP67 housing ensures the camera can be installed outdoors
      exposed to the elements.\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://blog.spycameracctv.com/announcing-our-range-of-hikvision-thermal-cameras\"
