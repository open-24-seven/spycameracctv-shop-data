    description: "<strong>B-Grade Product: 30% Off RRP</strong>\r\nThis item is an
      ex-display model or customer return.\r\n\r\nOur wireless bird box camera has
      been one of our most popular ever cameras, allowing you to easily watch chicks
      hatch in a nest box on your TV. However, we often get asked if you can view
      it on a mobile or tablet, and this isn't really possible without using a recorder.
      Now with our HD IP model, you can plug it straight into your router and, after
      an initial setup using a PC, log in via a mobile or iPad to view live wherever
      you are!\r\n\r\nThe camera itself has also been upgraded, now recording in 960p
      (1280x960) HD, providing the clearest possible image of the birds at home in
      the nest. IR LEDs provide clear night vision for recording after dark, and if
      there are good lighting conditions then the camera can record in colour. A wide-angle
      lens also helps get everything in the frame, even in the most compact nest boxes.\r\n\r\nThe
      kit includes a 20m Cat5e ethernet cable with waterproof connector, which runs
      straight from the camera to your router or network switch. Once configured via
      an app, you can then view the camera live on your mobile device. If viewing
      using a PC, then the CMS software lets you record footage, even using motion
      detection and scheduling.\r\n\r\n<i>We also offer a remote set up service to
      completely configure the camera for you, and provide ongoing support. <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/bronze-support-remote-setup-online-viewing-mobile-access\">See
