    description: "This 8 camera <strong>TurboHD TVI</strong> CCTV system from Hikvision
      is one of our best options for commercial or professional security, combining
      the incredible video resolution of an HD IP camera, with the intuitive plug
      and play installation of a traditional CCTV kit. \r\n\r\nTVI technology allows
      the cameras to send uncompressed, 1920x1080p Full HD video down a standard RG59
      coax cable. This lets the system record pin-sharp video, with enough detail
      to suit even the most demanding applications. Crucially, because the kit just
      uses standard RG59 cabling, if you have an existing CCTV system that uses this,
      then you can upgrade without even having to run new wires! The system uses Power-over-Coax
      (PoC), letting the cameras draw power from the record over the RG59 cable, and
      removing the need for additional power supplies.\r\n\r\n<i>You can use the drop-down
      menu at the top of the page to select the length of cables that you require
      for your installation. Already have cables? Simple! Just leave the menu blank
      and you can buy just the cameras and recorder</i>\r\n\r\nThe included cameras
      are perfect for retail or office security, as they are each housed inside a
      compact and discreet dome. Powerful LEDs provide up to 20m of night vision illumination,
      and the domes are all IP66 rated. This means you can install them in exposed
      outdoor locations without having to worry about the weather. Their size also
      makes them perfect for interior security, such as being mounted on a suspended
      ceiling, or viewing a doorway.\r\n\r\nThe Hikvision recorder is the \"brains\"
      of the system, providing in depth control over a wide range of recording modes,
      including motion detection and scheduling. An HDMI output allows you to easily
      connect it to most HD TVs or monitors, and there is also a network connection.
      Plugging this into your router allows you to watch recorded or live footage
      from your cameras securely over the internet using a PC or mobile."
