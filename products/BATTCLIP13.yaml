    description: "This tiny battery clip will let you power your camera using a standard
      9V \"PP3\" battery. Simply attach the clip to the battery terminals, then plug
      the cable into your camera. \r\n\r\nUsing a brand new good quality battery will
      give you around 90 minutes usage out of a camera with infrared, or just over
      2 hours for one without. <i>Because of this it is only recommended for use in
      temporary set ups</i>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Please note</strong>- Cheaper batteries
      will have significantly lower capacities. Please check your camera has a plug
      with a 1.3mm inner and 3.5mm outer diameter, and uses an 8-9V power supply."
    specification: "Inner Diameter: 1.3mm\r\nOuter Diameter: 3.5mm"
