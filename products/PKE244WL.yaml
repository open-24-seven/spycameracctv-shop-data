    description: "Since 2009 our farming and foaling camera kits have been helping
      farmers take the stress out of monitoring their animals by providing them with
      an easy way to keep watch over all their livestock from one central building.
      This new HD lambing camera system is the next generation in our range, providing
      farmers with more video quality, wireless range and convenience than ever possible
      before.\r\n\r\nAs opposed to traditional analogue CCTV cameras, this system
      uses advanced <strong>IP security cameras</strong>. These record high quality
      digital video and then send it as data down a network cable. As a result, the
      kit records in 1920x1080p HD, capturing images of your animals with more detail
      and definition.\r\n\r\nThis also means that, instead of using standard wireless
      transmitters, the system can use a pair of WiFi transmitters to send your video
      across huge ranges- up to 5km providing there is a direct line of sight between
      the devices. This lets you keep a constant watch over animals all the way on
      the other side of your property!\r\n\r\nAs well as 4 weatherproof cameras with
      30m night vision, the system also includes a 4-channel network video recorder
      (NVR). The cameras are wired into this central recorder in your barn or lambing
      shed, and then this is connected to the transmitter in order to send video from
      all 4 cameras. The NVR boasts a full set of adjustable features, including motion
      detection and scheduled recording, allowing you to keep an archive of footage
      on your chosen hard drive. The signal from the transmitter can then connect
      directly to your internet router, allowing you to view your animals on a PC,
      smartphone or tablet from anywhere with an internet connection!\r\n"
