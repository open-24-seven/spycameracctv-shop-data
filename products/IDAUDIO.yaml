    description: "This audio device answers the age old problem of how to get audio
      with a CCTV camera. Whilst many DIY products have audio built in, many professional
      products often don't. Often this is because for most professional CCTV situations
      you shouldn't record audio OR to include audio means drilling a hole in an otherwise
      waterproof camera housing.\r\n\r\nThe microphone is really designed for indoor
      use, but if you're careful and keep it dry or under cover it should be OK outside
      too. We've put a nice rain jacket on it but as you'll know if you've been out
      in the pouring rain for too long, even the best raincoat lets water in after
      a while.\r\n\r\nWhat's great is that you can add this microphone in-line, so
      the microphone can take it's power from the same DC cable as your CCTV (via
      the female input) and then feed the rest to the camera (via the male output).
      This means you only need to use 1 power adapter and you don't have to run 2
      power cables for the camera and audio separately."
