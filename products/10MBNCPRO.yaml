    description: "Just invested in one of our state of the art TVI Professional HD
      Cameras? This high grade 10m CCTV cable uses Copper RG59 cable to ensure a clean
      signal that won't compromise your camera's performance! This includes a pre-fitted
      BNC connector, so there's no need to worry about installing your own twist-fit
      adapters.\r\n\r\nThis Video cable runs alongside a 12V DC power cable, fitted
      with a 2.1mm jack. This means you will only have to run one cable out to your
      CCTV location, with no need for separate video and power lines!\r\n\r\nIs this
      not quite the length you need? We stock these cables in 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and
      60 metre lengths, and can even supply massive uncut reels! If you need any help
      with your installation, you can always call our specialist team of advisers.
      Just see our contact page for the easiest way to get in touch!"
