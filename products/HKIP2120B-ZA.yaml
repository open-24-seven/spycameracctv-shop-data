    description: "Hikvision has rightfully earned its place as the industry leader
      for CCTV surveillance, thanks to their rock solid build and cutting edge imaging
      technology. This outdoor security camera is no exception, packing a huge range
      of smart analytics features into a heavy duty body. It's perfect for use in
      demanding high traffic, large open spaces such as industrial estates, car parks
      and retail areas.\r\n\r\nThe camera is fitted with powerful infrared illuminators,
      allowing it to clearly record subjects over a huge 120m range. This is normally
      only possible with bulky PTZ cameras, and lets you cover a massive distance
      with a single camera. The motorised zoom lens also lets you easily shift between
      a 53 degree field of view to an absolutely tiny 3 degrees, perfect if you need
      to monitor one specific location from far away in 1080p detail. \r\n\r\nHikvision's
      range of Smart detection features lets you automate the camera with a host of
      settings including intrusion detection, line crossing, region entrance & exit
      and object removal, all completely adjustable to custom areas in the image.
      It even has an object counting function, perfect for monitoring traffic flow.
      With the camera connected to your network, these functions can all be adjusted
      from a Hikvision NVR, or from a PC running Hikvision's app. The camera also
      features an on-board MicroSD slot, which can be used to either capture short
      clips without a recorder, or act as an automated backup should you lose network
      connection."
