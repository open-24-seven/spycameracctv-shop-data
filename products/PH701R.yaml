    description: "B-Grade Product: 25% off!\r\n\r\nThis small pinhole spy camera is
      perfect for covert surveillance - it's really tiny, about the same size as a
      stock cube and the lens is just 3mm across, so it's really easy to hide! This
      wireless CCTV camera system can be positioned virtually anywhere. It will transmit
      wireless video with audio to the receiver which can be placed up to 50 metres
      away in clear line-of-sight. The receiver can be connected to a TV, or DVR via
      a composite connection. All the leads are of course supplied.\r\n\r\nYou can
      manually focus the small pinhole camera to enable you to get the best pictures.
      You can either power it from a larger 8V battery pack or the supplied mains
      power supply, although we recommend mains adapters for viewing 24/7. Using one
      of our battery packs you will get around 36 hours of camera use, but if you
      need to run from the mains we have extension cables at 5m, 10m or 20m lengths.\r\n\r\nThe
      small pinhole camera lens only needs a tiny hole of around 3mm to see through
      and the mini CCTV cam can be made almost totally invisible when installed properly.
      The camera is so light it can be mounted on a wall using just blu-tac! Even
      if your DIY skills are not up to much, you can still do a good job of installing
      this covert surveillance equipment behind books, discretely under clothes, behind
      ornaments etc. as it's only 2x2x2cm.\r\n\r\nFor businesses, this device can
      serve to monitor operations in offices, shops or warehouses, and is great as
      an affordable wireless spy camera system. It can also be installed alongside
      other CCTV video equipment with a DVR or other recording device, all of which
      we can supply if you require. It is an ideal mini camera for radio controlled
      helicopters as it's so light or as an indoor home CCTV camera.\r\n\r\nThis spy
      camera works great with our PC USB capture device, see our Other Customers Bought
      section on the right. The USB capture device allows the camera to be connected
      to your PC via a USB plug. SpyCameraCCTV will include a link to some free software
      which, if you connect the colour CCTV camera to a PC via an analogue video in
      port, will allow you to be able to record to your hard drive and/or broadcast
      over the internet for remote viewing anywhere in the world. The software also
      has motion detection triggering so you just record the bits you want from the
      spy cam video footage.\r\n\r\nThe built in wireless transmitter in the full
      colour spy camera has a range of up to 50m in clear line of sight. The tiny
      hidden camera has a high resolution of 700TV lines from its CMOS imaging chip
      and can be run off an 8V Mains adapter (supplied, of course)."
