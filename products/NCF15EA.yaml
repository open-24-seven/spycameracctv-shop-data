    description: "For anyone with a love of wildlife, a Bird Box Camera is a wonderful
      way to watch animals grow. Our Bird box cameras are in use all over world, including
      live streaming on the popular <a href=\"http://www.sparrowhawk-island.co.uk/live_sparrowhawk_and_wildlife_cams.php\"
      target=\"new\">Sparrowhawk Island</a> project. This new model- an adaptation
      of one of our most popular designs- uses a 700TV Line Sony EFFIO chip to provide
      exceptional quality video, full of fine detail. This makes it a fantastic option
      for public bird cameras such as website streams and in schools.\r\n\r\nKey to
      this camera's amazing quality is the Sony EFFIO imaging system. This combines
      a highly sensitive imaging chip with specially designed circuitry to provide
      image quality unsurpassed by anything else in it's class. Practically speaking,
      this allows it to provide a sharp video filled with fine details, perfect for
      feathers and wings! The recording resolution is an impressive 700TV Lines, capturing
      almost twice the detail of it's competitors! The Effio system also provides
      wonderfully clean video, with much less of the grain and noise that can effect
      more basic cameras.\r\n\r\nOf course, when recording at night, the can also
      use it's array of 10 Infra-Red LEDs to provide clear night vision. This allows
      you to keep an eye on what your resident birds are doing even at the dead of
      night. The LEDs are specially designed to work over short distances, so as not
      to 'blow out' the image with highlights when the subject is close.\r\n\r\nAs
      with all of our Wildlife cameras, this device is simple to set up- no need to
      hire a pro for the day! The camera uses a standard BNC connection, which can
      go straight into a <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spy/digital-video-recorders/stand-alone-dvr/\"
      title=\"Digital Video Recorder\">Digital Video Recorder</a>. With the included
      RCA Adapter, the camera can also be viewed live on any TV or Monitor. Of course,
      with such a high quality device, it's important to not compromise your picture
      with the wrong cables. See the drop down menu at the top for our range of pro
      grade shielded BNC cables, ideal for installation in your garden!\r\n\r\nOf
      course, if you have special requirements, such as wanting a wireless conversion
      or a custom installation, you can always get in touch with our sales team. Simply
