    description: "This exclusive kit combines one of our massively popular Wireless
      Pinhole Spy Cameras with a unique <strong>Mac Compatible</strong> USB Audio
      and Video Capture Device. This allows you to easily capture spy videos straight
      onto your Apple Macintosh Computer. This is a fantastic kit to use in so many
      ways- from a covert surveillance camera in the office to a great value discreet
      nanny cam for your home. The USB device comes with some easy to use recording
      and editing software, so making videos and uploading them could not be easier!\r\n\r\nThe
      camera is impressively small- making it easy to conceal behind furniture or
      in a bag. The tiny pinhole lens only needs a minuscule gap to see through, so
      the main body of the camera can remain safely tucked away from prying eyes!
      From here it can record full colour video at 700TV Lines resolution. \r\n\r\nThe
      integrated Wireless transmitter can reach the included Receiver from up to 50m
      away, although solid obstructions such as walls will reduce this by up to half.
      This means there is no need to run video cables to the device, all you need
      is to hook it up to the included Power Supply, or one of our Rechargeable Batteries
      for short term use.\r\n\r\nCrucially, this camera comes bundled with a fantastic
      USB Video capture Device for Mac. This allows you to use your Apple Computer
      as a recorder, capturing Video! This makes this kit a fantastic choice for covert
      recording in the home and at work- there's no need to mess around with complex
      DVRs."
