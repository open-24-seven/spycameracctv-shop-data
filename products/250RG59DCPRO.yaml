    description: "If you've invested in the best CCTV equipment, such as our Hikvision
      TurboHD or 16 Camera systems, then you don't want the quality of your system
      top be hampered by sub-standard cabling! Because of this, we are now stocking
      these MASSIVE 250m reels of <strong>professional grade</strong> RG59 coaxial
      cable. This is provided alongside 2 DC power cables, making the ideal way to
      run both power and video signals to your CCTV cameras. \r\n\r\n Unlike standard
      coaxial cabling, this high grade reel uses Bare Copper wire braiding to shield
      it's central conductor, providing impressively low attenuation. For those of
      us less technically inclined this basically means you can run a greater length
      of cable without a degradation in signal quality. both cables are also protected
      by a heavy duty 6mm PVC jacket, so they're safe to use outdoors, or even buried
      in the ground. If you're intending to install any wired CCTV cameras a distance
      away from your home, then it really pays to invest in this high grade cable!\r\n\r\nThis
      really is the ideal choice for professional CCTV installers- stock up in bulk
      to make easy work out of those large scale jobs. Of course you don't have to
      be a pro to use this gear, it's no more difficult than wiring up a HiFi. Our
      full range of <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/10-x-bnc-male-twist-on-connector-rg59-co-axial-coax-adapter-for-cctv\"
