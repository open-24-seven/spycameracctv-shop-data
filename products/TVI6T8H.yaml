    description: "This heavy duty 8 camera security system from Hikvision has been
      put together especially for the most demanding, accept-no-compromises CCTV applications.
      The kit uses <strong>TurboHD TVI</strong> technology to records amazingly detailed
      1080p images, but with an intuitive plug-and-play installation. No messing about
      with your network like with IP camera kits!\r\n\r\nTVI cameras use the latest
      encoding technology to send high resolution video footage down a standard RG59
      coax cable- the same type found in most traditional professional CCTV systems.
      This allows the system to record incredible levels of detail, essential if you
      need to capture evidence of licence plates or faces. As the system uses RG59
      cables with standard BNC connectors, you might even be able to use your current
      cables if you have an existing system. The system uses Power-over-Coax (PoC),
      letting the cameras draw power from the record over the RG59 cable, and removing
      the need for additional power supplies.\r\n\r\n<i>Using the drop down menu at
      the top of the page you can select the correct length of cable for your installation.
      If you already have cables installed then just leave this blank, and you can
      order the cameras and recorder by themselves.</i>\r\n\r\nAs is to be expected
      of such a system, the included cameras are some of the most versatile and heavy
      duty in our range. They are housed in IP66 rated casings, making them completely
      weather proof, and boast a huge 40m night vision range. They are also fitted
      with varifocal lenses, allowing you to manually adjust them from a wide view
      to a closer focus, meaning you can fine tune your system's coverage."
