    description: "AHD? TVI Turbo? 700TVL? Looking for a high quality CCTV recorder,
      but can't figure out which camera format is right for you? You don't have to!
      This DVR is compatible with all three of the most popular camera formats that
      use BNC connectors, making it a great option if you have a variety of camera
      types in your system, or if you are thinking of upgrading at some point in the
      future. This makes it a perfect crossover option for both smaller business properties,
      and demanding home users.\r\n\r\nThe recorder uses hybrid software, allowing
      it to capture Full HD from TVI cameras, such as Hikvision's Turbo HD models,
      as well as competing formats such as AHD. Not only that, but using the same
      BNC connectors you can also record footage from standard definition analogue
      cameras such as Sony's EFFIO range, and other 700 TVL models. This is a great
      benefit, as you won't have to commit to one format for the life of the recorder.\r\n\r\nThe
      DVR can record pin-sharp 1080p resolution footage from each camera, ensuring
      your security footage has more than enough detail to identify subjects. As with
      all of our professional recorders, the unit is kitted out with a suite of highly
      customisable recording settings, including motion detection and scheduling-
      all adjustable on a camera-by-camera basis. Footage is then recorded on your
      choice of preinstalled hard drive."
