    description: "This Power over Ethernet (PoE) injector & splitter set is ideal
      for setting up IP security cameras, as it allows you to run both video data
      and DC power down one length of ethernet cable, helping keep your system's wiring
      as simple as possible. \r\n\r\nThe female adapter connects straight to your
      power supply and network switch. You then connect this to the long ethernet
      cable that will out to the camera's location. On the camera end of this cable,
      you connect the male adapter, which in turn plugs into the camera's network
      and power connectors."
