    description: "CCTV heavyweights Hikvision have put designed this <strong>HiWatch
      TVI</strong> 8 camera CCTV system specifically for home users, providing extensive,
      high resolution coverage that won't break the bank. The kit is bundled with
      every single cable and connector required to get it up and running, making it
      a great choice for anyone planning a DIY installation on a large house or residential
      property.\r\n\r\nThe system includes 8 high definition turret cameras. This
      style of housing both protects the electronics and keeps the camera small and
      discreet, making it popular for interior spaces like shops. The housing is also
      IP66 weatherproof, so it's great for outdoor use as well. Infrared LEDs provide
      each camera with 20m of night vision, letting them work 24-7 in completely unlit
      spaces. The cameras work using HD-TVI technology, so all you have to do is plug
      them into power and then the back of the recorder and you're set, no confusing
      network configuration required.\r\n\r\nAs well as 10m cabling for each camera,
      the system includes an 8 channel DVR, capable of recording HD footage from each
      camera in 1080 lite resolution. IT ships pre-fitted with 2TB of storage - enough
      for around 2 weeks of footage - however this can also be upgraded if more space
      is required. By connecting the recorder to your network router, you can also
      configure remote access. Once set up, this lets you securely watch live and
      recorded camera footage from anywhere using a PC, phone or tablet."
