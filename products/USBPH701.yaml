    description: "This mini pinhole spy camera is ideal for covert security applications.
      Due to its tiny size this camera can be hidden out-of-view of suspecting eyes
      to discreetly capture what is happening in the room. Measuring just 3mm across
      and being able to see through gaps as small as this the camera can be hidden
      on a bookshelf or behind objects in the room without being noticed. To minimise
      the amount of wiring the camera features wireless transmission with a range
      of up to 50 metres in clear line-of-sight back to its receiver, which can be
      connected to a TV via RCA/SCART.\r\n\r\nIn this kit we have included our USB
      Video Capture Device, which allows you to record to your Windows PC without
      the need for a costly DVR. Supplied is free software from iSpy that features
      advanced recording options such as motion detection and scheduled recording
      so that you can configure recording to your specification. Footage is recorded
      to the PC's hard drive so that you can return to view it at anytime. Furthermore
      you can export footage to upload to YouTube and back up to the cloud. Please
      note that this is third party software and we do not support all features.\r\n\r\nTo
