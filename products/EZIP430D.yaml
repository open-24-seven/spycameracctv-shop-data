    description: "Though they may not be widely known outside of the security industry,
      Hikvision are the giants of the CCTV world, and a trusted name for installers
      & tradespeople the world over. Now with the <em>HiWatch</em> range of cameras
      and recorders they have brought their equipment to the home user. Using some
      of the same advanced image processing technology, these cameras provide professional
      grade video quality without the associated cost. \r\n\r\nThis 30m night vision
      dome is a fantastic example, recording huge 2688x1520 (4 megapixel) video files.
      This helps it capture fine subject details like faces and clothes, whilst Hikvision's
      3D DNR noise reduction keeps footage clear even in low light conditions. The
      dome is fitted with a 2.8mm wide angle lens, providing an 105 degree field of
      view perfect for interior spaces and doorways.\r\n\r\nThe camera runs using
      Power-over-Ethernet, letting it draw power from the network cable. This makes
      installation much easier, as you no longer have to set up a separate power supply
      for the camera. Once connected to your network, the simple software helps you
      configure the camera for recording, or viewing remotely using a PC or mobile
      device. Alternatively, connect it directly to one of our network video recorders
      to store large amounts of footage."
