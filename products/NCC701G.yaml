    description: "This Green Feathers wireless bird box camera can be used as a replacement
      to virtually any 4 channel 2.4Ghz camera system. 2.4Ghz cameras can be set to
      1 of 4 wireless channels. Whilst most bird box cameras on the market are pre-set
      to one of these, our bird box cameras have switches on the back, allowing you
      to change between them yourself, ideal if one channel is being affected by wireless
      interference.\r\n\r\nThe camera itself comes with a power adapter and providing
      you have a compatible receiver, LCD screen, Mini DVR or other equipment should
      simply plug in and play with your system. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This is a camera
      only. You will need to add this to an existing system with a receiver for it
      to work."
