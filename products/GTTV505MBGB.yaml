    description: "Our Mini Bullet Spy Camera is your next outdoor covert surveillance
      solution. It packs the higher resolution of bulkier overt CCTV cameras into
      a mini bullet camera to ensure it doesn't attract attention to itself. The black
      casing is IP66 rated meaning it is sealed from outside water ingress, making
      it suitable for outdoor usage. Due to its shape and the adjustable bracket,
      you can fit the camera into tight spaces and precisely point where you want
      the camera to look.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of pixels to go around in this camera,
      as it features a 5-megapixel sensor ensuring that this tiny device captures
      higher levels of detail than any of our previous spy cameras. There is minimal
      setup as you can simply connect up the camera to any recorder featuring a BNC
      connection to capture hours of footage. You can use one of our TVI recorders
      to record in resolutions up to 5MP or set it to CVBS mode to use with analogue
      recorders.\r\n\r\nWe have included an OSD controller so that you can fully control
      the camera's settings down-the-wire by using the mini joystick. This is important
      when it comes to setting it up with your recorder."
