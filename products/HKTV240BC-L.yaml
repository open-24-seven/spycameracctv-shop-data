    description: "Boasting a slew of advanced image features, this Hikvision Turbo
      HD TVI bullet camera is one of the most dependable and easy to use devices on
      the market for commercial security. The camera has been designed from the ground
      up to offer the absolute highest levels of picture detail, without the setup
      hassle needed with some IP systems.\r\n\r\nTurbo HD uses TVI technology to send
      and uncompressed 1080p HD video signal down a standard coax cable, providing
      the plug and play simplicity of a traditional analogue camera. In fact, if you
      are upgrading from a traditional security system, then you can use your existing
      cabling, saving the money and time needed to run new wires! It even supports
      Power-over-Coax (PoC), letting it draw power from a compatible DVR over the
      RG59 cable, and removing the need for an additional power supply.\r\n\r\nTo
      ensure the highest standard of picture quality around the clock, the camera
      is fitted with Hikvision's EXIR night vision illuminator. This helps record
      subjects up to 40m away with a much more even and uniform lighting than with
      traditional LEDs. It also boasts wide dynamic range (WDR) recording, helping
      retain detail in high contrast shadow and highlight areas. The camera's housing
      is IP66 rated, allowing it to be installed in the most exposed outdoor locations
      without risk of damage. This all makes it an ideal option for recording in a
      driveway or garden.\r\n\r\nTo see just how impressive this Turbo HD camera is
      compared to standard 700TVL CCTV, just check our real world sample footage in
      the videos section!"
