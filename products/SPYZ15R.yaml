    description: "B-grade products are items that have either had their packaging
      opened, been used for testing & demonstration by our sales team or have been
      returned by a customer. They have only seen light use, but will have been removed
      from their boxes, and may show cosmetic signs of usage.\r\n\r\nThanks to its
      integrated <strong>rechargeable battery</strong>, this slim HD pinhole mini
      DVR is one of our most versatile devices for covert recording! The battery means
      it can be used extensively without a single trailing wire or cable that could
      otherwise attract attention. This flexibility, coupled with its incredibly small
      size and light weight make it an ideal choice for a wide array of covert applications!\r\n\r\nCentral
      to this camera's usability is its extensive list of recording triggering modes,
      allowing it to be tailored to a wide variety of situations. These include <strong>vibration
      triggering</strong> using a built-in g meter. This will start recording as soon
      as it detects a shockwave nearby, making it ideal for dashboard recording in
      a car. <strong>Voice triggering</strong> is perfect for covertly recording meetings
      or discussions*. Finally, <strong>motion triggering</strong> allows the recorder
      to be used as a security camera, initiating recording as soon as it detects
      movement in the frame.\r\n\r\nThese recording options are especially powerful
      when combined with the device's impressive battery life. The internal battery
      is capable of recording continuously for up to 10 hours non stop, and when used
      with vibration triggering can remain on standby for an incredible 4 months!
      This gives you the freedom to leave it in remote locations with no power source,
      or for long periods of time in spots that prevent cables, like in a desk drawer.\r\n\r\nThe
      records crisp High Definition footage straight to a Micro SD card slot, allowing
      easy storage and transfer for your videos. The device works with cards up to
      64GB in size, equivalent to 32 hours of footage with the higher quality settings,
      or an astounding 128 hours with a reduced frame rate! If the card does fill
      up, then the circular recording option can automatically begin to record over
      older footage, meaning you only have to use the device when you want to check
      for suspicious incidents!\r\n\r\n<i>*Always consult with local police before
      covertly recording discussions as regulations may vary</i>"
