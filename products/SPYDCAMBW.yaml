    description: "As has been made all too clear by a host of recent news stories,
      body worn cameras are the single most effective way for security employees to
      objectively document incidents. Good quality video and audio from the perspective
      of a doorman or security guard can make all the difference in proving that any
      action taken was justified, or gaining a conviction.\r\n\r\nThis compact and
      unobtrusive body worn camera easily clips onto outer clothing, recording detail
      packed video in 1080p Full HD resolution. All footage is also time & date stamped,
      ensuring it can be used as effective evidence. The imaging sensor is also sensitive
      right down to 0.03 lux, ensuring you can still keep recording in challenging
      lighting conditions.\r\n\r\nVideo can also be streamed in real time to an Android
      or iOS mobile device using the built-in Wifi connection. The free app also lets
      you view and trigger recording, providing a simple way to check footage without
      a PC. Video is recorded to the built-in MicroSD slot, with a 16GB card included
      as standard. A long life Lithium battery allows over 3 hours of continuous use
      in between charges. "
