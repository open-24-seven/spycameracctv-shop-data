    description: "Hikvision has rightly earned their reputation as the leading manufacturer
      of CCTV equipment on the market, with their cameras trusted to secure everything
      from airports to arenas. Their HiWatch IP range of cameras and brings this reliability
      and image quality to the home user, with great value equipment designed for
      a simple set up. This turret camera is one of the most advanced in the range,
      boasting 4 megapixel video and motorised zoom.\r\n\r\nThe camera captures twice
      the level of detail of full 1080p, with 2688x1520 images. Combine this with
      a lens that can be remotely zoomed from a 98 degree to 30 degree field of view,
      and you have a device capable of recording huge amounts of usable subject detail.
      Other features include a 30m night vision range for use in large unlit areas,
      and an IP67 weather proof housing that allows use outdoors as well as inside.\r\n\r\nThe
      IP camera connects to your network router or switch, letting you watch and record
      remotely via a PC or mobile app. Alternatively, connect to an NVR to allow long
      term recording with multiple cameras. The camera also uses Power-over-Ethernet,
      meaning it can draw power from the network cable, and does not need to be set
      up with a dedicated power supply (requires PoE compatible recorder or switch)."
