    description: "Wireless CCTV is one of the simplest ways of setting up a security
      system to protect your home, as you don't need to run cables from the recorder
      to the cameras. One thing that often catches people out, however, is that wireless
      CCTV <em>still needs to connected to a power supply</em>, so you're still usually
      left having to run cables through a wall or window. This innovative new Gamut
      battery-powered CCTV system is designed to solve this. The cameras use Lithium
      Ion batteries, allowing a completely wire-free installation.\r\n\r\nEach camera
      features a built-in PIR sensor, able to detect movement from a subject's body
      heat in order to trigger recording. This also uses minimal battery power, allowing
      the camera to remain on standby for up to 6 months per charge, waiting to be
      triggered. Video is recorded in sharp, detail-packed 1080p, with 8m of night
      vision. It's even got a built-in speaker, allowing you to talk back to subjects
      through your mobile device. \r\n\r\nAlso included in the kit is a wireless recorder
      with a preinstalled 1TB HDD to store footage. The recorder connects to up to
      6 cameras at a time, allowing you to expand the kit with up to two additional
      cameras at a later date. Connecting to your router lets you configure remote
      access, allowing you to view and control your cameras from a PC or mobile device.\r\n\r\n<strong>Please
      note:</strong> As with all wireless transmissions, the range of the cameras
      will vary depending on the layout and materials used in the building. Obstructions
      such as walls and windows between the camera and receiver will affect the wireless
      signal. </span><a href=\"https://help.spycameracctv.com/getting-the-best-range-from-your-wireless-cameras/\"
