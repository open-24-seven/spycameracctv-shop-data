    description: "PTZ (pan tilt zoom) security cameras are ideal for larger properties,
      letting you remotely control the camera's movements using a motorised base,
      and look around your property. This flagship dome security camera takes a PTZ
      housing, and combines it with a top-of-the-line 1080p HD IP camera, marrying
      functionality with professional-grade image quality. This combination makes
      it the perfect choice for a huge range of applications, including warehouse
      security, car parks or offices.\r\n\r\nWhereas as traditional CCTV cameras record
      analogue video, IP cameras record it digital, and then send it as data down
      a network cable. This not only allows it to record a much higher level of detail
      than previously possible, but also lets you connect it directly to your internet
      router to view live footage remotely over the internet. This camera uses a professional
      grade colour CMOS sensor in order to record video at 1920x1080p full HD resolution
      (approximately 2 megapixels). When combined with the powerful zoom built into
      the camera, this allows you to record fine details such as detailed faces with
      more clarity than ever before. This is even paired with powerful night vision
      LEDs, allowing it to keep recording subjects up to 50m away in the dead of night.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera's motorised base can easily be controlled using the included PC software.
      This lets you watch and control the camera remotely at the touch of a button.
      The base has complete 360 degree movement, with fine adjustments allowing it
      to rotate and pan with varying degrees of speed. You can even program in up
      to 220 pre-set points for the camera to move to, or up to 4 programmed \"tour\"
      movements between them, letting you easily automate the camera's movements.\r\n\r\n"
