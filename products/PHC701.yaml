    description: "This tiny pinhole spy camera is perfect for hidden camera installations
      or covert surveillance. It measures just 56x60x45mm and only needs a 2mm hole
      to see through, which makes it easily concealable in regular household items
      and perfect for private investigators and James Bond wannabes.\r\n\r\nThe pinhole
      camera uses a CMOS imaging sensor for 700 TV Lines of resolution and a sensitive
      microphone for recording audio. It then transmits the video signal wireless
      on 1 of the 4 available 2.4 GHz channels.\r\n\r\nTo select a different channel,
      simply flick one of the switches on the back of the mini pinhole camera. This
      allows you to make sure this camera doesn't interfere with any existing wireless
      2.4 GHz cameras you may have or wireless broadband.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This
      is a camera only. You will need to add this to an excising system with a receiver
      for it to work."
