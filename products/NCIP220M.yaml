    description: "We are proud to present the UK's first HD IP bird box camera, from
      our exclusive Green Feathers brand which allows you to watch the inside of your
      bird box over the internet via smartphone or iPad - all in incredible HD! There's
      no other bird box camera on the market that is true HD or accessible over the
      internet.\r\n\r\nOur <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/wireless-birdbox-day-night-hidden-camera-receiver\">wireless
      bird box camera</a> has been one of our most popular cameras, letting you easily
      watch your little feathered family from the comfort of your TV. However, we
      often get asked if you can also view it on a mobile or tablet, and this isn't
      really possible without using a recorder. But hurray! For we now have some chirpy
      news: with our new HD IP model, you can plug it straight into your router, and,
      after an initial simple setup using a PC, log in via a mobile or tablet to have
      a live view of your hatching chicks in their nest box, wherever you are!\r\n\r\nThe
      camera itself has also been upgraded, now recording in 1080p HD, providing the
      clearest possible image of the birds at home in the nest. IR LEDs provide clear
      night vision for recording after dark, and if there are good lighting conditions,
      the camera can record in colour. A wide angle lens also helps get everything
      in the frame, even in the most compact nest boxes. Perfect for whenever Tweety
      is dozing off in a far corner for a bit. \r\n\r\nThe kit includes a 20m Cat5e
      ethernet cable with waterproof connector, which runs straight from the camera
      to your router or network switch. Once configured via an app, you can view the
      camera live on your mobile device. If you're viewing via a PC, the CMS software
      lets you record footage, and, if used with a NAS drive, you can even set up
      motion detection and scheduled recording.\r\n\r\n<i>We also offer a remote setup
      service to completely configure the camera for you, and provide ongoing support,
      through our Freshdesk site, and via our support ticket system, email and phone
      service. <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/bronze-support-remote-setup-online-viewing-mobile-access\">See
      here</a> for more details about the setup</i>. A little side note: we always
      welcome happy stories and new videos of your feathered friends, so feel free
      to share them!    "
