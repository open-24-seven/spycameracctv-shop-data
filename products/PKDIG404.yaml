    description: "Wireless CCTV cameras are a great option if you are looking for
      a simple DIY installation, as all you need to do is plug them in to a power
      supply. Often however, you have to compromise on a recorder to go with them.
      Not so with this system! For this digital wireless security system we have combined
      long range wireless CCTV cameras with a professional grade DVR. This provides
      both a quick installation and in depth recording options, perfect for home security.\r\n\r\nThe
      kit's 4 bullet cameras are housed in IP66 rated waterproof casings, making them
      suitable for indoor or outdoor use. When used in unlit areas, they can still
      record clearly thanks to night vision LEDs that provide 15m illumination. Thanks
      to digital wireless transmission technology, they can send VGA resolution video
      to the receiver from up to 100m away in direct line of sight. Digital wireless
      also helps keep interference and picture breakdown to a minimum. \r\n\r\nThe
      4 cameras are picked up by 2 dual receivers, which then plug straight in to
      the professional DVR. The recorder is loaded with a complete suite of in depth
      recording settings, including motion detection and a 7 day schedule. Other features
      include HDMI output and PTZ and alarm inputs. The recorder also features a network
      connection, letting you plug it in to your router. Once configured, this allows
      you to log in to view live and recorded footage remotely, using a PC or mobile
      device. As an added bonus, the recorder is a hybrid HD model, so if you upgrade
      to 1080p cameras at a later date it will still work!"
