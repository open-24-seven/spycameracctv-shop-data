    description: "Our bird box cameras are incredibly popular, providing an easy way
      to watch families of chicks hatch and grow inside of a nesting box. It's no
      surprise then, that we are often asked for a similar way to view wildlife in
      more open areas. This garden wildlife camera kit is the answer, featuring a
      compact but powerful night vision camera, along with all the connectors you
      need to view and record it on your PC. It's ideal for monitoring everything
      from badgers, hedgehogs and foxes, letting you get close to all the wildlife
      right at your back door!\r\n\r\nThe kit includes a compact CCTV camera, easily
      concealed on the edge of some bushes or amongst vegetation. Despite its size,
      it features 20 metres of night vision, allowing it to clearly record subjects
      even in larger unlit gardens. The housing is also rated IP66 waterproof, ensuring
      it can be installed in the most exposed locations without being damaged by the
      elements.\r\n\r\nThe kit features everything you need to view and record it
      on a PC. This includes a 20m AV cable to run back to your house, and a USB video
      connector to plug directly into your computer. The software lets you either
      watch live footage or record short clips using motion detection. You can also
      plug the camera directly into a monitor or CCTV recorder using an RCA connector."
