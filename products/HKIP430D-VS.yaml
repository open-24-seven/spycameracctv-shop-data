    description: "Recording twice the subject detail of 1080p Full HD cameras, this
      Hikvision 2MP dome camera is a great choice for demanding security applications
      such as bars, pubs and venues. It can record video at up to 2560x1920 resolution,
      for files packed with usable detail that can be enlarged and still be sharp.
      This dependable image quality has helped make Hikvision's cameras the trusted
      workhorses for CCTV installers across the globe.\r\n\r\nAs part of their latest
      range, this camera also boasts a range of smart detection features. These can
      be controlled either from a recorder or from Hikvision's free remote access
      software, and provide an unprecedented level of control for your system's recording.
      Examples include intrusion detection over custom selected areas and line crossing
      detection.\r\n\r\nThe camera itself is housed inside of an IP67 rated weatherproof
      and vandalproof dome, making it suitable for outdoor use. At the same time,
      it's compact size and shape make it a popular choice for discreet recording
      indoors. Infra red LEDs provide 30m night vision range, and a wide angle lens
      helps capture everything within a 103 degree field of view in front of the camera.
      It also features a MicroSD card slot, which can be used to record footage without
      an external NVR, or even as an <a href=\"https://blog.spycameracctv.com/using-hikvision-anr-to-backup-cctv-footage\"
