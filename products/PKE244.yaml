    description: "Though perhaps not a household name, Hikvision are the largest manufacturer
      of CCTV on the planet, and one of the most trusted brands in the global security
      industry. SpyCameraCCTV are proud  to offer the latest in their HiWatch IP range,
      providing low cost, easy-to-install home security systems that don't compromise
      on quality. This 4 camera kit is a perfect example, recording pin sharp video
      in 1080p Full HD. It's a great choice for securing the family home.\r\n\r\nThe
      cameras' IR LEDs allow 30m night vision range, helping keep even large unlit
      spaces secure 24/7. They are built into IP67 rated weatherproof housings, allowing
      them to set up outdoors exposed to the elements. They're also each fitted with
      a wide angle lens, capturing every subject within a 106Â° field of view. Power
      over Ethernet means that they can draw power from the network cables, so you
      don't need to worry about setting up 4 separate power supplies, either.\r\n\r\nThe
      system is also bundled with an 8 camera network video recorder (NVR) to control
      the recording and store footage. As with all of our professional CCTV recorders,
      it's kitted out with a host of motion detection and scheduling modes. Just select
      a suitable hard drive size from the drop down at the top of the page. The recorder
      connects directly to your router and, once configured, enables remote and mobile
      access. This means you can check up on live or recorded footage from anywhere
      using a PC or mobile device."
