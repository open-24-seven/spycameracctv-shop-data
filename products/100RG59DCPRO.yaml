    description: "When you've invested in the highest standard of CCTV equipment-
      such as our Sony EFFIO range cameras- it's vital that you don't compromise the
      quality of your image by using sub standard wire or connectors. This 100m reel
      of <strong>professional RG59 cable</strong> uses braided copper shielding in
      order to greatly reduce impedance, and therefore signal degradation over longer
      distances. The uncut reel means you have much more flexibility when planning
      the camera's layout, as you can simply cut the cable to a custom length.\r\n\r\nIn
      order to use the Co Axial RG59 Cable with our CCTV Cameras you will need a pair
      of Twist-Fit BNC Connectors (one for each end of the cut cable).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/rg59-co-axial-coax-male-bnc-twist-on-connector-adapter-for-cctv-camera\"

      we also sell these connectors in packs of 10, which can be found here:\r\n\r\n<a

      2 Stranded Wires that are combined with the Co Axial RG59 Cable can be used
      for carrying a low voltage. This means that you can also power your CCTV Camera
      from your DVR's end and not have to worry about having a power source near to
      the CCTV Camera's location.\r\n\r\nIn order to use the 2 Stranded Wires to power
      one of our CCTV Cameras you will need a pair of DC Jack Connectors (one for
      each end of the cut cable).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/male-jack-connector-adapter-5mm-outer-2mm-inner-screw-terminal\"
