    description: "<strong>B-grade 25% off</strong>\r\nThis product is a customer return
      or ex-display model. The packaging will have been opened but the contents have
      been fully tested. It might have minor cosmetic defects.\r\n\r\nDiscreet, lightweight
      and miniature this powerful surveillance device combines WiFi connectivity,
      MicroSD card recording, HD video and clever triggering modes. Due to the spy
      camera's inconspicuous appearance, it can be hidden almost anywhere. This makes
      it extremely useful for home, office and shop security surveillance where you
      do not want suspecting eyes knowing where the camera can be found.\r\n\r\nTeaming
      up the camera with your iOS or Android smartphone allows you to view what the
      camera is seeing wherever you are in the world. Thanks to the dual WiFi mode
      you can also connect to the camera directly using a P2P connection within a
      150-metre range. Using the 'Attez' app you can live view and download video
      and images to your smartphone. This makes it very simple to access the hidden
      camera without having to move it or even be in the same room.\r\n\r\nVideo and
      images are captured through a wide-angle lens providing a generous field-of-view.
      Acting as a standalone DVR, video is recorded in 720p HD with plenty of storage
      space to storage provided by a MicroSD card slot that supports cards up to 128GB
      in capacity. Once the card is full you can set the device to automatically overwrite
      old footage so that you do not worry about constantly changing the card. As
      with all our SPYZ devices, the camera features motion and voice triggering modes,
      which can be enabled so that only the most important footage is recorded. The
      WiFi spy camera is fully configurable using the Windows and Mac software. Just
      plug the device into your computer using the provided USB cable to get it customised
      to your specification."
