    description: "Need an economical cabling solution for an 8 or 16 camera security
      system? This huge 250m reel of aluminium shielded Coaxial CCTV cable features
      both RG59 video and DC power lines, preventing you from having to run 2 cables
      out to each camera. This means this 2 way cable can help you save both money
      and time when wiring your CCTV system. As this is an uncut reel, it also provides
      much more versatility than standard cables, as you can cut them to exactly the
      size you need for each camera.\r\n\r\nTo prep the cable for installation, all
      you need to add is a pair of our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/rg59-co-axial-coax-male-bnc-twist-on-connector-adapter-for-cctv-camera
      target=\"new\">twist fit BNC connectors</a>, letting you hook it up to the camera's
      video output. These don't need any special tools to install, just a sharp knife
      to cut back the outer covering. Then, simply add a pair of our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/search/?search=powerjack\"
      target=\"new\">Powerjack connectors</a> to plug into your 12V mains supply.
      Again, no special tools are required, and it's no more fiddly than wiring a
      pair of speakers.\r\n\r\nNaturally, if you have any questions at all about your
      set up, just give our dedicated tech support team a call. To find the easiest
      way to get in touch just check our <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/contact.php\"
