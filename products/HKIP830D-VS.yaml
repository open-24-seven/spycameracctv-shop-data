    description: "The last few years have seen an explosion in CCTV technology, meaning
      small business and home users now have access to cameras that were previously
      prohibitively expensive. Our range of <strong>Hikvision 4K</strong> cameras
      is a perfect example, recording footage with 4 times the resolution of 1080p
      HD devices, all at a price that would have been unthinkable even a year ago!
      \r\n\r\nThis 8MP dome camera packs this amazing recording technology into a
      discreet housing, perfect for use in shops or offices. It captures images with
      3840x2160 resolution, enough detail to make out specific faces, or to track
      subjects moving through a crowd. Other camera features include 30m of night
      vision for 24 hour security, and an IP67 rated housing, allowing indoor or outdoor
      use.\r\n\r\nThe IP technology means the camera connects directly to your network
      using an ethernet cable, and can then be viewed remotely from a PC or mobile
      device, or be connected to an NVR. The camera uses Power over Ethernet (PoE),
      allowing it to draw power from the network cable, removing the need for an external
      plug. The high resolution also allows the use of advanced smart features, such
      as facial recognition and intruder detection."
