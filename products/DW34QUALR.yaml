    description: "When setting up a CCTV system over a large property such as a farm
      or warehouse, the distances involved can be incredibly problematic: completely
      impractical to run cables, and beyond the range of most wireless systems! Luckily,
      this fantastic 4-camera quad wireless CCTV system uses the latest generation
      of digital wireless to achieve massive ranges with a clear, interference-free
      signal! We have used all of our years of experience helping customers set up
      bespoke wireless CCTV systems in order to put together this powerful kit.\r\n\r\nTo
      achieve the optimum image quality and durability, this system uses 4 Hikvision
      security cameras, which are in turn connected to a quad processor. This displays
      a live split-screen feed of each camera, which is then transmitted straight
      to your office or living room with the included digital transmitter/receiver
      kit. By setting our system up like this, you only need a single receiver rather
      than one for each camera, and so save on both the hassle of setting them up
      and <i>quite a bit of money!</i>\r\n\r\nAt the core of this kit is the amazing
      <strong>digital wireless system</strong>, that not only provides its massive
      200m transmission range, but ensures the cleanest possible wireless signal.
      No more squinting at static! This advanced transmission method also means the
      signal is encrypted, so there's no danger of any nosy neighbours picking up
      your security video. Please note - solid obstructions such as walls and doors
      will reduce signal strength by up to half. Because of this we always recommend
      installing the included high gain antennae on the exterior of buildings, so
      they have the clearest possible line of sight.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the kit are
      4 weather-resistant security cameras, each fitted with energy-efficient infrared
      LEDs. This allows them to clearly see up to 20 metres of night vision. In addition,
      one of the kit's cameras is fitted with a microphone, allowing it to record
      audio from inside the building you are monitoring."
