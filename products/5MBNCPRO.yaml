    description: "Invested in one of our TVI Professional HD Cameras? With high quality
      cameras it's vital that you have a cable to match, otherwise a poor signal can
      degrade the image that you get from the device. This professional grade 5m cable
      is made with high copper RG59 cable, helping to ensure there is minimal signal
      breakdown. It is also pre-fitted with BNC and power connectors, so you don't
      need to worry about installing your own.\r\n\r\nThe cable runs alongside DC
      power wires, allowing you to run video and power down to the camera via the
      same cable, helping to reduce the amount of wiring required for your system.\r\n\r\nNeed
      a different length? We also have these pro grade cables in 10, 20,30,40,50 and
      60 metres length, as well as large uncut reels if you want to put together a
      bespoke system."
