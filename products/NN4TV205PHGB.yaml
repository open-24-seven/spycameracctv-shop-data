    description: "Whilst it's not often talked about, staff theft is one of the biggest
      potential problems for retail businesses, accounting for up to a third of stock
      losses due to theft. As employees will usually know the location of security
      cameras, it can be quite tricky to catch them out in the act. Because of this,
      using a covert security device such as this HD spy camera is a great way to
      catch them red-handed and keep your stock safe. \r\n\r\nDespite it's small size,
      this camera packs in a 1080p Full HD colour sensor, allowing it to record images
      loaded with identifiable subject detail. It works using 4-in-1 technology, so
      it's compatible with CCTV systems that use HD-TVI, AHD, CVI or analogue video
      formats. This makes it a perfect option if you need to add it to an existing
      system. \r\n\r\nThe camera itself measures only 37x37x20mm, making it easy to
      hide behind a shelf or in a drawer. The pinhole lens can then record through
      a gap as small as 2mm wide, so the camera itself can stay safely out of view.\r\n\r\n"
