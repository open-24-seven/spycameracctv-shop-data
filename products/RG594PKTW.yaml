    description: "This little pack contains all of the adapters and ends you need
      to connect 4 cameras using our larger uncut cable reels. The kit includes 8
      BNC twist connectors for the video cables, and 4 each of make and female DC
      power connectors. Our uncut cable reels are all made from high grade copper
      RG59 cable, making these a great way to get the best from professional cameras
      such as Sony's EFFIO range.\r\n\r\nThe included BNC twist connectors are simple
      to add to your cable, and just need wire strippers- no special tools."
