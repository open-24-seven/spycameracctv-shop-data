    description: "This small pinhole spy camera is perfect for covert surveillance
      â€“ it's tiny, about the same size as a stock cube and the lens measures just
      3mm across. This means it can be positioned virtually anywhere. To save on the
      cabling that you would need to run from the camera to the TV the camera features
      an inbuilt 2.4 GHz wireless transmitter. This provides a wireless range of up
      to 30 metres in clear line of sight back to the receiver. The receiver can be
      connected to a TV or recorder using a composite video connection. All the cables
      you need are supplied.\r\n\r\nYou can manually focus the camera to enable you
      to get the best pictures. You can either power it from a battery pack or use
      the supplied mains power supply, although we recommend mains adapters for 24/7
      viewing. Using one of our battery packs you will get around 36 hours of camera
      use, but if you need to run from the mains we have extension cables at 5m, 10m
      or 20m lengths.\r\n\r\nThe small pinhole camera lens only needs a tiny hole
      of around 3mm to see through and it can be made almost entirely unnoticeable
      to the naked eye when installed properly. The camera is so light it can be mounted
      on a wall using a small amount of adhesive. If your DIY skills are not up to
      much, you can still do an excellent job of installing this discreetly behind
      objects as it measures only 2 centimetres across.\r\n\r\nFor businesses, this
      device can serve to monitor operations in offices, shops or warehouses. It can
      also be installed alongside CCTV video equipment with a DVR. \r\n\r\nThis spy
      camera works great with our USB Video Capture Devices. This allows you to connect
      the camera to your PC to view and record footage. The free software supplied
      also has motion detection triggering so you just record the bits you want from
      the spy camera video footage."
