    description: "For years now we have provided industry-leading CCTV solutions for
      remotely monitoring livestock and farm buildings. Our products help take the
      stress out of breeding season by keeping a constant eye on animals, and help
      protect thousands properties from theft. Because we're always to improve our
      products, we are proud to announce our first HD TVI farm security system. TVI
      cameras record incredibly detailed 1080p video, whilst only needing a simple
      plug-and-play installation. Pairing this with a ridiculously powerful wifi transmitter
      makes this barn camera kit one of our most impressive solutions.\r\n\r\nThe
      kit features 4 Hikvision TVI bullet cameras, packing amazing recording quality
      and 40m night vision into a tiny, unobtrusive housing. They are also IP66 rated,
      making them suitable for installation in even the most exposed outdoor locations.
      These simply plug in to the included DVR using twist fit cables. The recorder
      lets you easily view cameras individually or as a split screen in Full HD. Adding
      an optional Hard Drive also lets you take advantage of a huge range of professional
      recording modes, including motion detection and 7 day scheduling.\r\n\r\nThe
      cameras connect to the recorder located in your barn, and this links to your
      home router using a pair of high power wifi bridges. These are capable of transmitting
      over a massive distance- up to 3km in direct line of sight- making them suitable
      for remote farm buildings. Once configured to your network, you can then remotely
      check on the livestock in your barn from anywhere, using a PC or mobile device."
