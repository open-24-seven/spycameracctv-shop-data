    description: "Hikvision's Turbo HD-TVI is one of the most popular CCTV camera
      ranges on the market today, combining detail packed HD recording with a simple
      plug-and-play installation. This professional grade bullet camera is one of
      the latest models in this range, packing an immense recording resolution of
      5 Megapixels (2592x1944), that's over twice the detail of Full HD! The TVI interface
      makes all of this possible without the complex configuration required for an
      IP camera. It even supports Power-over-Coax (PoC), letting it draw power from
      a compatible DVR over the RG59 cable, and removing the need for an additional
      power supply.\r\n\r\nThe camera also features a motorised lens, letting you
      remotely zoom the camera from a 87Â° wide angle to a 28Â° close crop. Combined
      with the massive recording resolution, this makes the camera ideal for monitoring
      large spaces such as car parks or long driveways, where traditional cameras
      might not be able to make out subject detail such as faces or licence plates.\r\n\r\nOther
      features include 40m clear night vision from Hikvision's EXIR LEDs, and a fully
      weatherproof IP67 rated housing to allow outdoor installation. The camera connects
      to a compatible recorder using a standard twist-fit BNC connector, just plug
      it in and you're good to go! Don't forget to make sure your DVR can work at
      5MP resolution - our range of <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/hikvision-turbohd-tvi-4-channel-1tb-1080p-hd-dvr-mobile-access\"
