    description: "We get a lot of requests for wireless CCTV options, as there are
      many circumstances where cables are simply not possible. But why should wireless
      mean you have to compromise on your Wi-Fi, other wireless equipment in your
      house or on the number of wireless cameras you can have working at once? It
      shouldn't, and with our digital wireless transmitter/receiver pairs it doesn't
      any more!\r\n\r\nThese digital 2.4GHz wireless packs are now almost completely
      interference free from Wi-Fi and other 2.4GHz devices, and this in turn means
      it's almost always possible to have 8 of these running simultaneously! Digital
      also means a greater range - up to 100m* in a clear line of sight, and combined
      with two of our 7dB aerials around 200m.\r\n\r\nThese work perfectly with all
      700TVL or analogue cameras, transmitting a full D1 resolution image complimenting
      any analogue camera in our range.\r\n\r\nThe receiver is fitted with 2 audio
      and 2 video outputs, allowing you to connect it to both a monitor and recorder
      at the same time. It even comes with 4 AV cables, so you don't need any additional
      wiring to get it connected to your existing system.\r\n\r\n* With a completely
      clear line of sight. Please note walls and thick solid objects can reduce signal
      strength typically by 60% (depending on material and construction)."
