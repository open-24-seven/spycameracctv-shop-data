    description: "Imagine the peace of mind of knowing that you have a covert security
      camera to hand, wherever you go. This key fob conceals a tiny spy camera, providing
      a way of recording video and audio that can fit right in your pocket, on a keyring.
      Despite it's size, it can capture 1080p HD video or 5 megapixel stills, all
      to the included MicroSD card.\r\n\r\nA built-in Wifi transmitter means you can
      log in to the camera using an Android or iOS mobile device, providing an easy
      way to view live or recorded video, and even control recording. Even with Wifi
      active, the battery holds enough charge to allow just over an hour of continuous
      recording. To keep the camera secure, a special \"hide the SSID\" mode prevents
      other devices from detecting it using Wifi.\r\n\r\n"
