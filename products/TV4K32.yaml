    description: "8 Megapixel - or 4K - is the flagship resolution for CCTV, recording
      hugely detailed images with over 4 times the subject detail of 1080p. This allows
      you to gain exceptional, quality even from small crops of the picture, ideal
      for recording in areas like busy bars, clubs and car parks. Up until recently,
      however, 8MP meant IP cameras, and a complex configuration over a network. Hikvision's
      Turbo HD range changes this, providing incredible detail whilst still using
      traditional, plug and play coaxial cables.\r\n\r\nThis security system uses
      two Turbo HD bullet cameras, along with a professional grade recorder to control
      them. Despite their compact size, the cameras are rated IP67 weatherproof and
      boast 40m of night vision. This makes them suitable for both indoor and larger
      outdoor spaces. \r\n\r\nThe DVR is also part of the Turbo HD range, ensuring
      it can record footage from the cameras without any loss of picture quality.
      It includes a wide range of recording features such as motion detection and
      24/7 scheduling, as well as your choice of hard drive to store the files. By
      connecting the DVR to your network router, you can even set up remote access,
      letting you view cameras and control settings from anywhere using a mobile or
      PC."
