    description: "Hikvision's range of IP PTZ cameras are a fantastic way to monitor
      large spaces with moving subjects, such as car parks, fields or lobbies. One
      common problem, however, is that the cameras themselves can be very bulky, often
      making them both impractical to mount and also indiscreet. This mini PTZ camera
      is an ideal solution, miniaturising their advanced imaging and analytics technology
      into a compact package. Don't let the size fool, though - it packs a host of
      smart features, including line crossing, intrusion, region exiting, face & object
      removal detection, as well as a host of others.\r\n\r\nThe camera is built around
      a 2 megapixel imaging chip, recording video footage at 1080p full HD. When combined
      with the powerful 25x optical zoom lens, this lets you see subjects impressively
      far away, or lets you move in for unbeatable detail on closer subjects - we
      have had farmers use these to read the tag numbers on their cow's ears. The
      camera is sensitive right down to 0.005 lux, letting it record in colour even
      in low light levels. Below this it uses a powerful IR illuminator to view subjects
      up to 50m away (at full zoom).\r\n\r\nThe camera can be controlled directly
      using a mobile phone or tablet app, or by using a Hikvision NVR and a PTZ joystick
      controller. As well as manual control, you can program up to 8 patrol movements,
      or 300 individual camera positions. The camera even has a MicroSD slot which
      can be used as an automated backup should the connection to your recorder be
      lost."
