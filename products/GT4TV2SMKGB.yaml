    description: "Looking for a professional quality hidden security camera for monitoring
      an office or shop? This smoke detector housing conceals an HD spy camera, recording
      from a tiny lens on the side of the unit. When installed on the ceiling of a
      shopfloor or stockroom it looks like any other commercial smoke detector, however
      this one lets you monitor the room in 1080p Full HD!\r\n\r\nThis is part of
      our first covert camera range to feature TVI HD technology, a type of cutting
      edge surveillance video format that was previously only available in large,
      bulky security cameras. This allows you to still record clear video full of
      usable video, whilst still keeping your security system discreet. What's more,
      TVI video uses standard BNC connectors, so if you have an existing system then
      you can potentially use the same coaxial cabling.\r\n\r\nWhen installed in the
      ceiling, the video and power cables can be run into the top of the camera, keeping
      them concealed from view. Just like a standard CCTV camera this HD spy camera
      does not have built in recording, but can be connected to any TVI-compatible
      CCTV DVR in order to capture footage.\r\n\r\n"
