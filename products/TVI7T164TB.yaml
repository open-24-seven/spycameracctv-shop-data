    description: "If you're a small businesses owner with large property such as a
      warehouse or car park, it can be tricky to get adequate CCTV coverage. Larger
      systems can easily run into multiple thousands of pounds. With your business
      in mind, we have put together this 16 camera HD CCTV system, using Hikvision
      Easy TVI cameras that record clear, high resolution footage without blowing
      your budget.\r\n\r\nThe cameras use HD-TVI technology, letting them record in
      1920x1080p Full HD resolution. Crucially, the video format makes this possible
      using standard plug-and-play coaxial cables, so there's no need for a tricky
      network configuration. Not only this, but each camera boasts 20m night vision
      range for use in unlit areas. The discreet turret housings are great for use
      in indoor spaces, but IP66 rated weatherproofing ensures they can be used outdoors
      as well.\r\n\r\nThe kit includes all of the cabling and connectors needed to
      get it up and running, with a huge 250m reel of RG59 CCTV cable. We have alos
      included a professional grade 16 channel DVR from Gamut, capable of recording
      1080p footage from every camera with no loss of quality. We've preinstalled
      a massive 4TB hard drive, although this can be upgraded with up to 12TB if needs
      be. You can also connect the recorder to a router in order to enable remote
      access, letting you view live or recorded footage from anywhere in the world
      using a PC, phone or tablet."
