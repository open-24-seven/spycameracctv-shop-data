    description: "Unleash the power of Hikvision's Darkfighter cameras and Smart NVR
      with this professional ANPR CCTV bundle. This system's unique feature is <strong>Automatic
      Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology</strong> allowing the cameras to
      capture vehicles' registration plates and send the key data to the NVR. \r\n\r\nIncluded
      are two Hikvision Darkfighter cameras that are designed for outdoor, bright
      environments where subjects may be lit by the sun from behind. Ordinarily for
      cameras with auto-exposure this would mean that it compensates by underexposing
      often leading to silhouetted subjects. The Darkfighter cameras overcome this
      with wide dynamic range (WDR) and smart imaging technology to ensure that the
      subject is always properly exposed and focussed.\r\n\r\nBased on IP technology
      the cameras send Full 1080p HD images with a frame rate of up to 50 fps over
      network cable without the need for additional power cabling. This leads back
      to the Smart NVR, which has a built-in PoE switch for powering the cameras.
      The recorder boasts a new GUI interface and intuitive video content analysis
      modes for a range of security applications. Pre-installed with a 2TB hard drive
      for plenty of recording storage, the NVR allows full-quality HD recording and
      synchronous playback of up to 16 cameras.\r\n\r\nCrucially you can hook the
      system up to your network for remote access of your cameras from virtually anywhere.
      This proves very useful if you want to monitor the cameras from a different
      location to where the recorder is located.\r\n"
