    description: "Installing a high grade camera such as a TVI HD model, with an additional
      microphone? High grade cables such as RG59 are usually sold \"shotgun\" style,
      with a video and power line, but no connector for audio. Uniquely, this professional
      quality RG59 cable gives plenty of length with 3-way video, audio and power.
      This cable is unterminated and needs connectors attached to it.\r\n\r\nWe also
      have these cables in 5m, 10m, 20m, 30m, 40m, 50m and 60m lengths so you can
      be sure to find what you're looking for."
