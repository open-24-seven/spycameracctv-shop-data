    description: "The Camswitch Mobile range from Veracity has been designed to provide
      a simple way to power multiple Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) devices from a 12V
      or 24V source such as a car battery. This makes it perfect for setting up an
      in-car security system using high resolution IP cameras.\r\n\r\nOnce the switch
      is wired in to your car battery, it can output a total of 80w of power, with
      ports for 4 separate cameras and a recorder. The power output is compatible
      with most PoE and PoE+ devices, using standard ethernet cables. It's an ideal
      way to set up a security system for a taxi or bus."
