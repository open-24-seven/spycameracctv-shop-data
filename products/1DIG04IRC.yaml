    description: "Whether you're just looking for a single camera to watch over a
      doorway, or an addition to a larger security system, this digital wireless camera
      & receiver kit is a great value solution. The included camera is protected by
      an IP66 rated weatherproof case, allowing installation in exposed outdoor locations.
      IR LEDs also provide 15m night vision illumination, essential for watching over
      unlit gardens or driveways.\r\n\r\nThe camera transmits back to the included
      receiver using digital wireless technology. This helps prevent picture breakdown
      due to interference, and allows a huge range of up to 100m in direct line of
      sight. The receiver uses an industry standard BNC connector, so it can plug
      right into the back of any CCTV recorder, or directly into a BNC monitor."
