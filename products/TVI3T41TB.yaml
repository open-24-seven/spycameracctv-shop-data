    description: "Looking for the fantastic clarity and image quality provided by
      HD IP cameras, but intimidated by by the prospect of an involved set up on your
      network? There is another way! This Turbo HD TVI CCTV security system uses Hikvision
      cameras to ensure the best possible image quality, whilst still using a simple
      plug and play installation. This makes it ideal for everything from demanding
      home users to smaller business properties.\r\n\r\nTVI technology uses advanced
      encoding in order to send amazing quality 1080p  Full HD video down an RG59
      cable, the same type used by many traditional CCTV systems. It means that- if
      you have an existing CCTV system on your property- then you might not even need
      to run new cables! This makes it a perfect kit for existing CCTV users looking
      for an upgrade in quality.\r\n\r\n<i>You can add cables to your system with
      the drop down menu at the top of the page, or choose to leave them out if you
      are upgrading the cameras and recorder in an existing system</i>\r\n\r\nIncluded
      in the kit is 4 compact Hikvision bullet cameras, each with 40m of night vision
      range for round the clock monitoring. They also boast a weatherproof housing,
      making them ideal for both indoor and outdoor security. Their size makes them
      a great option for installing in a doorway, or under the eaves of a house.\r\n\r\nThe
      powerful Gamut recorder is kitted out with a wide range of advanced recording
      options, including independent motion detection and scheduling settings for
      each camera. Footage can be recorded at 1920x1080 Full HD on each channel, and
      stored on the pre-installed 1TB hard drive. As well as connecting to a TV or
      monitor, you can monitor the footage remotely by logging in securely over the
      internet with a PC. Once configured, you can even check your cameras on-the-move
      using a smartphone or tablet."
