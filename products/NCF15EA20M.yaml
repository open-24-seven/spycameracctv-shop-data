    description: "Our wired bird box camera with Sony chip provides splendid video
      quality, much better than our standard camera. This clarity kit includes a 20-metre
      cable to connect the camera to a TV or recorder, and has a tiny camera, making
      it perfect for bird nesting boxes â€“ it wonâ€™t even spook any camera-shy birds!\r\n\r\nThe
      camera boasts focus from just a few inches up to around 30 meters, enabling
      you to get the best image no matter how far the object is from the lens. The
      detail is excellent, for example, if youâ€™d focus the camera on your finger,
      you could see the ridges on your fingernail! You'll even catch the little barbs
      of the feathers, speckles on the eggs, or the adorable expressions on the fledglingsâ€™
      faces - and we know you wouldn't want to miss those.\r\n\r\nThe 3-way 20-metre
      cable (supplied) connects the camera directly to your TV/recorder and carries
      video, audio, and power, so you only need to install one cable between the camera
      and your house.\r\nLonger cables are available should you need to cover a greater
      distance. Simply call our team for more information.\r\n\r\nThis tiny camera
      measures just 50 x 50 x 30 mm (think of a slightly chubby square matchbox),
      which makes it a good fit for any bird nesting box, hive, den or hole. Furthermore,
      the No-Glow infrared LEDs, allowing round-the-clock viewing, wonâ€™t disturb
      any birds or other animals, arenâ€™t too powerful (so they wonâ€™t risk bleaching
      the background), but are just right for seeing in a small space.\r\n\r\nOur
      customers use this cam system for watching owls, buzzards, and small birds such
      as nesting blue tits. The cameras are also popular with bird breeding professionals,
      who use them across multiple aviaries. For bigger nests, some customers have
      chosen our slightly larger 30 LED product or our CCD bird box camera, available
      from our complete packages/specialist kits section.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
