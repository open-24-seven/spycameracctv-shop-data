    description: "This <strong>HiWatch TVI</strong> 8 camera CCTV system has been
      designed by industry heavyweights Hikvision as a great value option for home
      security, perfect for users with a large property to cover on a tight budget.
      The all-in-one kit includes every cable and screw needed to get it up and running,
      so it's a great option if you're planning a DIY installation for your own house.\r\n\r\nThe
      system includes 8 bullet cameras with IP66 rated weatherproof housings, ideal
      for both indoor and outdoor use. Each camera has 40m night vision range, enough
      to monitor unlit spaces such as gardens, garages and porches at all hours of
      the day. The cameras use HD-TVI technology, so all you have to do is plug them
      in and connect them to the recorder with the included cables and they're good
      to go - there's no confusing configuration like with IP cameras.\r\n\r\nThe
      recorder is also part of the HiWatch TVI range, capturing HD quality footage
      from all channels in 1080 lite resolution. This provides clear video files with
      plenty of detail, should they need to be used as evidence. The recorder is pre-fitted
      with a 2TB hard drive, but this can also be upgraded if you need to store more
      than 2 weeks of footage. Connecting the DVR to your network lets you enable
      remote access. Once configured, you can use this to check live or recorded footage
      from anywhere in the world using a PC, phone or tablet."
