    description: "Our Green Feathers team has over a decade's experience designing
      and selling specialist camera kits for recording and observing wildlife. Now
      we can proudly announce that we have teamed up with the artisans at Riverside
      Woodcraft to bring you our first range of bird houses. Each one has been purpose
      designed for installing one of our bird box cameras. It makes an ideal project
      for a family or school, letting you watch as birds nest, hatch and grow in the
      nest, all from a unique close up view. \r\n\r\nThis De Luxe box is built from
      sturdy 21mm thick wood, significantly more heavyweight than the lighter, less
      durable designs on the market. The box also carries the badge of the Forest
      Stewardship Council, ensuring that it's only produced from sustainable sources
      of wood. The front of the box has a 32mm entrance hole, ideal for Tits and Sparrows.
      The front plate can also be removed, providing an open box design preferred
      by Robins and some larger birds.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the box is designed
      with extra height, providing your camera with the widest possible of view of
      both the nest and the entrance. It also leaves additional space for one of our
      <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/daylight-white-led-light-nest-bird-boxes\"
      target=\"_blank\">daylight LEDs</a> if required. The camera can easily be mounted
      via the screw hole in the back of the box, and the cables routed out via the
      air vents under the roof. The kit also includes a set of mounting plates and
      screws for use when hanging the box."
