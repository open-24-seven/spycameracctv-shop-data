    description: "This full TurboHD TVI system from Hikvision is simple enough to
      set up for home users and high enough quality and flexible enough for a variety
      of commercial or retail security scenarios. Combining the benefits and strengths
      of IP camera systems and traditional CCTV the system boasts incredible quality
      HD video as well as intuitive plug and play features for a stress free set-up.\r\n\r\nTVI
      Technology allows the sending of full, uncompressed HD video down a standard
      RG59 Coax cable. This provides you with footage which is crisp and rich in details
      vital for security purposes and means you can upgrade without needing to set
      up a new network of cables.\r\n\r\n(You can select the length of cables you
      need for your system from the dropdown menu at the top of the page, or leave
      it blank if you already have cables in place and just want to upgrade your cameras
      and recorder.)\r\n\r\nThe cameras featured in this kit boast an impressive set
      of advanced features meaning they are up to the demands of even the most professional
      security applications. The high quality 2.8-12mm Varifocal lens gives a field
      of view between 92 and 32 degrees and 40 Metres of Night Vision illumination
      gives you full and flexible coverage of the areas you want to secure.\r\n\r\nThe
      DVR recorder, also produced by the award winning Hikvision, boasts a suite of
      professional DVR functions. Full HD 1080p is included with HDMI output and a
      variety of networking options. To make your system highly customisable and flexible
      there are options for Motion Detection triggering, scheduled recording and many
      other controls which can be assigned on a camera by camera basis."
