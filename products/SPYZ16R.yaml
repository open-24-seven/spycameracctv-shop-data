      return or an ex-display model that is in a good condition but may have some
      light cosmetic damage. \r\n\r\nOur venerable <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/mini-720-hd-spy-video-recorder-sound-motion-detection-micro-sd\"
      target=\"new\">720 HD battery powered spy video recorder</a> is one of our most
      trusted and popular cameras, with a combination of long battery life and customisable
      recording modes that makes it incredibly versatile. It is with great excitement
      then, that we can unveil the latest evolution of this camera range, taking the
      tried and tested design, and adding a wide angle lens, set on a rotating mount.
      This adds another level of flexibility to the camera, making a device ideal
      for home security, vehicle security, covert workplace recording and much more.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera features an ultra wide angle lens, capturing a massive 160Â° field of
      view, effectively recording everything that goes on in front of the camera.
      This is then fitted to a rotating lens mount that can be twisted around 180Â°
      on the edge of the device. This gives you much more freedom when setting up
      the camera, for example letting you lie it down flat on top of a suspended ceiling,
      with the lens pointing downwards to record through a gap.\r\n\r\nJust like it's
      predecessor, the camera boasts a host of adjustable recording modes. As well
      as standard scheduled and continuous recording, the camera can be set to trigger
      video capture when it detects motion, sound, or even vibrations. When combining
      the vibration capture and scheduled modes, this allows the camera to remain
      on standby for weeks at a time without charging the internal battery. All of
      these recording modes are controlled using the camera's intuitive software widget,
      available as a free download from the <a href=\"http://www.zetta.com.hk/index.php/supports/downloads\"
