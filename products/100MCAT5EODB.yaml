    description: This 100m reel of uncut Cat5e ethernet cable is perfect for large
      scale installations of IP cameras or PTZ cameras, letting you cut exactly the
      length you need for your setup. The cable is wrapped in a durable outer jacket,
      letting it be used for outdoor installations exposed to the elements. Connect
      the cable with standard RJ45 adapters, or use without to connect PTZ devices
      directly to the internal twisted pairs.
