    description: "Whilst not a household name, Hikvision is the largest CCTV manufacturer
      on the planet, and is rightly an industry heavyweight. They have made their
      name supplying high end, high resolution camera systems for commercial applications
      such as football stadiums and train stations. Now, with the release of their
      new <i>HiWatch</i> range, home users can take advantage of their amazing image
      quality as well! This compact dome IP camera is no exception, and boasts simple
      setup and 2 Megapixel images, all at a great price.\r\n\r\nThe camera records
      in 1080p Full HD, capturing highly detailed images that can be used for clear
      identification. It also packs infrared LEDs, providing 30m of night vision illumination.
      This is essential for use in unlit areas after-hours. The lens is a 2.8mm wide
      angle, so it can record everything within a large 95Â° field of view. All of
      this is crammed into a compact IP67 rated weatherproof housing, suitable for
      exposed outdoor use.\r\n\r\nThe Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) camera draws power
      from the network cable, so as long as you have a compatible recorder or network
      switch, it doens't need a mains power supply. Once connected to your network,
      it's a simple process to configure remote access, letting you watch it from
      a PC or mobile device. Alternatively, connect it to an NVR to record footage
      for extended periods.\r\n\r\n"
