    description: "This 2.4GHz directional antenna is a fantastic way to greatly increase
      the range of most wireless CCTV systems. the device boosts a transmitter or
      receiver's gain by 10dB, massively increasing it's power. What's more, as the
      unit only sends signal in a focussed 70 degree wide arc, it can achieve distances
      much greater than similar omnidirectional models. The antenna mounts flat to
      an external wall, so there's no need to set up a pole to hold it. We have also
      included a 1m cable and a complete set of connectors, so should will work right
      out of the box with all of our standalone transmitters and receivers.\r\n\r\nThis
      antenna will massively boost the range of wireless systems, but the huge number
      of factors impacting wireless performance means we cannot provide specific estimates
      for range."
