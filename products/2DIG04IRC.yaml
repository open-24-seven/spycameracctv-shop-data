    description: "Whether you need a simple camera to watch your front door or need
      something to add to a larger system, this digital wireless CCTV kit is a fantastic
      option. Including 2 outdoor cameras and a receiver, this is an easy to use wireless
      kit perfectly suited to most home applications.\r\n\r\nThe included cameras
      are made of lightweight yet heavy duty plastic, providing them with IP66 weather
      sealing whilst keeping their weight much lower than similar cameras. The power
      cable connects to the camera through the middle of the mounting bracket, keeping
      the cables hidden away from any potential vandals. They also feature 15m of
      infra red night vision, making them ideally suited for monitoring an unlit doorway
      or small garden.\r\n\r\nBoth the cameras transmit video to the receiver using
      digital wireless technology. This not only allows increased range over standard
      wireless cameras- up to 100m in direct line of sight- but also helps reduce
      interference from other wireless devices. The receiver itself can plug straight
      into CCTV DVR (not included) if you want to record footage. There are even 2
      outputs, allowing you to view or record each camera separately."
