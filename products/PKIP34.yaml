    description: "Hikvision are the most established and trusted name in CCTV technology,
      with cameras protecting homes and businesses across the globe. This 4 camera
      IP CCTV system uses their latest range of ultra high resolution 4 megapixel
      (4MP) cameras to capture images with twice the detail of even 1080p Full HD.
      This level of detail makes them one of the most powerful options on the market
      for constant recording, but without the storage demands of 4K. The system is
      ideal for advanced home or retail security.\r\n\r\nThe cameras pack all of this
      recording power into a surprisingly tight package, measuring only 15cm with
      the bracket. The housing is also rated IP67, for the highest level of waterproofing
      available for CCTV cameras. Infra red LEDs provide 30m of night vision to make
      sure your property is still secured after dark. The sensor's wide dynamic range
      also ensures it can record detail in challenging high contrast lighting. Crucially,
      the cameras also work via POE, or Power-Over-Ethernet. This means the recorder
      can send power to them down the cable, removing the need for additional power
      supplies. The camera also features Hikvision's latest range of smart video analytics,
      letting you automate your coverage with intrusion, object removal or face detection.\r\n\r\nThe
      recorder itself can be pre-fitted with your choice of hard drive, with options
      up to a huge 6TB. As with all of our professional grade CCTV recorders, it has
      a host of adjustable recording modes. These include motion detection, scheduling,
      and even triggering from an external alarm. The NVR has an HDMI output to watch
      the cameras live on a TV or monitor, or you can watch remotely using a PC, mobile
      or tablet."
