    description: "Pan-Tilt-Zoom- or \"PTZ\"- cameras are ideal when flexible coverage
      and powerful zoom are needed, especially for unpredictable or moving targets.
      To use them to their full potential however, a good quality controller is essential.
      This joystick controller is designed specifically for PTZ IP cameras, and gives
      you intuitive fingertip control over your cameras, making it much easier to
      track subjects.\r\n\r\nUniquely, this controller also features a built-in CCTV
      monitor on which you can view the camera's footage. This provides you with far
      more freedom when setting up your system, as you don't need to connect the controller
      to recorder. \r\n\r\nThe controller itself uses a 3 axis joystick, allowing
      you to easily pan the camera around, and the zoom the lens with a quick twist.
      You can also save camera positions as a preset, and then snap back to them at
      the press of a button. Other presets include a 360 degrees tour, and an A-B
      transmit between two saved positions.\r\n\r\nTo setup the controller just connect
      it to the same network as your IP camera, and add the device using the onscreen
      menu. As no recorder is needed, you can easily set up a quick monitoring system
      relatively quickly. This makes it fantastic for mobile or temporary installations. "
