    description: "Wireless CCTV is one of the best options if you want to secure your
      property, but need a simple installation or a quick setup. This 2-camera digital
      wireless CCTV kit is an all-in-one solution for a home or small shop, with 1080p
      cameras and a combination screen & recorder. Everything you need to get it up
      and running is included, making it a great option for DIY security.\r\n\r\nThe
      cameras record in 1920x1080 Full HD, recording amazing levels of detail for
      a wireless camera. Infrared LEDs provide 10m night vision ensuring you can monitor
      round the clock, even in unlit areas such as gardens or driveways. Uniquely,
      the cameras also include a built-in passive infrared (PIR) sensor, designed
      to pick up movement from a subject's body heat. This allows much more accurate
      motion detection than traditional CCTV, with less accidental recording. Footage
      is transmitted to the monitor using digital wireless, providing a clean and
      secure signal, with much less risk of interference.\r\n\r\nThe monitor itself
      is packed with features, including a 9\" colour touch screen to watch live footage,
      or files recorded to the built-in MicroSD card slot. Recording can be customised
      with a range of scheduling and motion detection modes, helping you automate
      your system with great ease. The screen even has a built-in Lithium rechargeable
      battery, letting you easily move it to different locations in your home while
      in use. Plugging the device into your router will also allow mobile access.
      The free iOS and Android app lets you view live or recorded footage from wherever
      you are, using a phone or tablet."
