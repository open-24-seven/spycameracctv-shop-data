    description: "Power over Ethernet (or PoE) cameras help make it a breeze to set
      up an IP security system. They draw power from the same cable as they use for
      data, preventing the need for annoying external power supplies. In order to
      use them however, you need a device with the right interface. This Hikvision
      PoE network switch can power up to 4 IP cameras, whilst also helping your network
      manage the increased data traffic.\r\n\r\nThe device features 4 PoE ports for
      the cameras, as well as one uplink port to connect to your router. This allows
      you to set up multiple IP cameras without having to wire them all directly into
      the back of an NVR."
