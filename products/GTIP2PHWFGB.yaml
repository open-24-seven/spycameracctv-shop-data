    description: "Don't be fooled by its absolutely minuscule size, this WiFi spy
      camera packs a host of recording features. Whether you need to keep an eye on
      the stock room or monitor an elderly relative's care, this tiny device lets
      you discreetly monitor & record without needing a bulky and expensive external
      recorder.\r\n\r\nThe camera is tiny, measuring only around 15mm deep, letting
      you easily conceal it in a desk drawer or behind a shelf, needing only a 2mm
      gap for the pinhole lens to record through. The IP camera records sharp, detail-packed
      video at 960p HD resolution (around 1.3 megapixels). The highly sensitive imaging
      chip can also work right down to 0.01Lux, so it can keep recording even in poorly
      lot areas. The built in antenna allows the camera to work over your WiFi network,
      so you can easily view it on a PC, phone or tablet without having to plug it
      into your router. \r\n\r\nCrucially, the camera's MicroSD card slot lets you
      record footage directly from your PC or mobile device without needing a bulky
      external recorder. The remote access software even lets you set motion detection
      and recording schedules to make sure you don't miss any important activity.
      The camera is compatible with cards up to 128GB in size (not included).\r\n\r\n<strong>Need
