    description: "Looking for a robust CCTV camera for a demanding security job, that
      provides the highest levels of image quality, but spares the hassle associated
      with setting up an HD IP camera over a network? This Hikvision Turbo HD TVI
      outdoor dome camera is the perfect solution, making it suitable for a huge range
      of tasks.\r\n\r\nTurbo HD TVI technology sends uncompressed, high resolution
      1080p video down a simple coax cable with standard BNC connectors. This a allows
      a plug-and-play setup, and means you can even use existing cabling if you are
      upgrading an existing system! The image quality recorded is simply stunning,
      easily capturing fine details at 1920x1080p. <i>Please note, TVI cameras will
      only be compatible with TVI recorders</i>.\r\n\r\nThe camera's dome casing is
      both vandal proof and weather proof, able to help protect it in even the most
      demanding outdoor locations. Housed inside this is a powerful ring of IR LEDs,
      providing an impressive 40m of night vision illumination. The camera also features
      a 2.8-12mm varifocal lens, allowing you to precisely adjust the angle of view
      from 92Â° to 32Â°. The camera also features a range of adjustable image settings,
      including dynamic noise reduction, and high dynamic range. The latter allows
      you to retain plenty of shadow and highlight detail in high contrast situations
      such as doorways and in front of windows.\r\n\r\nNo matter if it's outside a
      building or monitoring the interior, this feature packed camera is sure to impress.
      Don't just take our word for it though- check out the videos section for real
      world sample footage demonstrating the quality possible."
