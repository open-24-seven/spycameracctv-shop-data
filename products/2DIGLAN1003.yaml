    description: "This fantastic wireless kit boasts a wealth of security features
      and can be easily set up with minimal wiring and a DIY setup. The results are
      top notch with 720p HD images which can be viewed remotely from your smartphone
      or tablet wherever you are in the world! This easy set up wireless system is
      perfect for home security or for a small business. You add an extra 2 cameras
      at a later date if you need to cover more area when you move house or grow your
      business.\r\n\r\nThe cameras in these new kits record at 720p HD quality which
      is unheard of for wireless technology, this means your footage will be more
      detailed and useful to you if the worst should happen. The cameras also feature
      built in PIR sensors allowing recording to be triggered using a subject's body
      heat which is far more reliable than standard motion detection. Rounding off
      the features a powerful set of LEDs allows up to 10 metre night vision for your
      footage also. \r\n\r\nThe footage is transmitted to the recorder/monitor unit
      using an advanced digital signal which helps reduce interference and ensures
      the signal cannot be picked up by anyone.\r\n\r\nThe monitor device combines
      a wireless receiver and a 9\" LCD colour monitor and build in MicroSD DVR. This
      means all your controlling, viewing and recording can be done from this single
      device, which can also be run from battery power allowing it to be portable
      anywhere in your home. \r\n\r\nFor mobile access simply connect the receiver
      device to your internet router and quickly set up using a QR code, you will
      then be able to view your footage live from a camera, smartphone, tablet or
      other mobile device.\r\n"
