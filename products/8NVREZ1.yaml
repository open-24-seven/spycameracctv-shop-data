    description: "Hikvision is the worldâ€™s biggest manufacturer of CCTV and is one
      of the most trusted names for supplying professional installers. Their HiWatch
      range is designed for ease-of-use with home and small business users in mind.
      Despite being IP-based this recorder is easy to use and still has many of the
      features found in high-end recorders. Supporting up to 8 cameras that are 2-megapixels
      or 4 cameras that are 4-megapixels you can easily connect the HiWatch cameras
      you need for your system.\r\n\r\nDue to a built-in PoE compatibility, you can
      power up to 8 IP cameras without the need for separate power supplies, significantly
      reducing the amount of cable you need to run. Total recording storage is maximised
      thanks to the clever H.264+ compression, which effectively reduces the storage
      space needed by up to 50%. Smart functions, such as smart search, can help you
      easily find what you need to within the recorded footage.\r\n\r\nWhen connected
      to your network you can easily remotely access the recorder to view live and
      recorded footage, as well as tweaking settings. This is easily carried out using
      Hikvisionâ€™s PC software and the smartphone app. You can also connect the recorder
      to your monitor or TV using the HDMI or VGA output."
