    description: "IP camera systems provide the highest resolution cameras available
      on the market, capturing more detail than ever previously possible. There can
      be a downside to this though, the high processing demands mean it can be difficult
      to find a way to monitor all of your cameras without a slow, stuttering frame
      rate - even with a high end recorder. Luckily, we have a solution. This IP decoder
      from Hikvision has a dedicated processor, letting you watch live footage from
      8 megapixel IP cameras at a smooth 30 fps. This makes it a perfect tool for
      dedicated security offices.\r\n\r\nThis model decoder has one HDMI output, letting
      you watch up to 4 8MP cameras in a split screen view on a 4K UHD monitor. It's
      adaptable to other formats as well, letting you watch 2x 12MP, 6x 5MP, or even
      16x 1080p cameras, all with perfectly smooth motion. The LAN connection means
      it doesn't need to be directly connected to the cameras or a recorder, just
      connect it to a switch on the same network. The professional grade device also
      features alarm in/out, and connections for a PTZ controller, letting it seamlessly
      integrate into an existing security system."
