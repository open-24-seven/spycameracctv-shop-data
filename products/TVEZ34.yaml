    description: "The <strong>HiWatch</strong> range of cameras and recorders has
      been designed by Hikvision to bring their advanced camera technology to home
      and DIY installers. This means intuitive, easy to setup cameras, which still
      provide pin sharp images. This home CCTV system is a great example, with 4 cameras
      and a digital video recorder. It all fits together using standard twist-fit
      BNC cables, so it's a great option if you want to upgrade an existing CCTV system
      without rewiring your property.\r\n\r\nThe cameras themselves are rated IP66,
      meaning they're completely weatherproof and suitable for use indoors or outdoors.
      Infrared LEDs provide 20m night vision for clear recording at all hours. Images
      are captured with a 1080p HD sensor, ensuring videos are packed full of detail.\r\n\r\nThe
      included HiWatch DVR has a host of recording features, including motion detection
      and 24/7 scheduling, all fully adjustable camera-by-camera. Footage from all
      cameras is recorded at 1080lite quality, onto your choice of preinstalled hard
      drive. By connecting the DVR to your network, you can also configure remote
      access. This lets you view cameras and adjust settings from anywhere using a
      secure PC or mobile app.\r\n\r\n"
