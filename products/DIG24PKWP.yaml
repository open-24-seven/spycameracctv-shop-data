    description: "This robust CCTV transmitter kit provide extra flexibility to your
      CCTV system, by freeing you from the limitations of hard wired cables. This
      also means you can convert heavy duty professional CCTV cameras- usually only
      available as wired connections only- into a long range wireless system. This
      makes them perfect for use on large properties such as farms.\r\n\r\nThis particular
      kit improves on our standard audio and video transmitter set by encasing both
      the transmitter and receiver into durable IP66 housings. This means they can
      hold up to the worst the elements can throw at them, and is essential if they
      are going to be set up in exposed outdoor locations. They are also wall mountable
      for a simple installation. This kit is also unique in that both devices feature
      spare audio and video output cables. This allows you to connect to more than
      one device, for example setting up a local monitor by the transmitter, or connecting
      the receiver to a monitor and a DVR.\r\n\r\nLike all of our selection of long
      range equipment, this kit uses digital wireless technology. This helps ensure
      a clean signal with significantly reduced interference from other devices, and
      secure pairing that prevents other nearby users from potentially picking up
      your video. The powerful transmitter can work up to 100m in clear line of sight,
      though this can easily be increase by adding high gain antennae."
