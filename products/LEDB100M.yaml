    description: "This powerful IR illuminator is an ideal addition to any outdoor
      night vision CCTV system, helping extend your camera's night vision range, or
      \"fill in\" areas of the image that would otherwise be in shadow. The lamp features
      a light sensor, so the device can automatically switch on when light levels
      start to drop at sunset. \r\n\r\nThe illuminator can reach subjects up to 100m
      away, working in a much wider field than LEDs built into cameras. It will work
      with any camera that is sensitive to IR light, including almost all wired CCTV
      cameras that feature \"IR-Cut auto switching\"- including many that don't even
      have night vision themselves! Consult your camera's specifications for more
      information."
