    description: "For years now our <a href=\"https://www.green-feathers.co.uk\" title=\"Green
      Feathers\" target=\"_blank\">Green Feathers bird box cameras</a> have been delighting
      nature lovers by providing amazing close up images of eggs & chicks, direct
      from your garden to your TV screen. Now, however, our new WiFi bird box camera
      lets you easily log in to watch or record footage directly from your phone or
      tablet. As the first camera of its type on the market to feature built-in WiFi,
      you don't even need to run a network cable out to the bird box - all it needs
      is power!\r\n\r\nJust make sure that there is WiFi signal where you want to
      install the bird box in the garden, and then follow the simple configuration
      instructions in our setup guide. You can then watch live or recorded footage
      of the chicks from anywhere using an Android or iOS mobile device. If your WiFi
      signal does not reach your garden, then don't worry! Our home plug WiFi extenders
      are a great way to reliably increase your signal's range, and can be added from
      the menu at the top of the page. \r\n\r\nThe camera itself features invisible
      IR night vision LEDs, that provide clear illumination in the dark bird box without
      disturbing the animals. A 2.8mm wide angle lens also means that you can get
      the entire inside of the box in the frame. The tiny microphone means the camera
      will record sound as well as video. A MicroSD slot allows you to easily record
      footage - and even set up motion detection - directly from the app without having
      to set up a bulky external recorder."
