    description: "We frequently speak to customers who find that even 1080p full HD
      cameras don't have enough resolution for their needs. For example, if you need
      to identify specific faces, monitor large crowds of people, or track small subjects
      in a large area, then you need to record the most detail possible. Thankfully,
      our selection of Hikvision 4K CCTV kits record huge 8 megapixel video files
      (380x2160), resolving <i>four times</i> the subject detail of 1080p.\r\n\r\nThis
      system is no exception, featuring 3 high resolution but compact turret cameras.
      The discreet housings make them ideal for retail or club security. They are
      also IP67 rated, making them weatherproof and suitable for outdoor use. What's
      more, they also boast HIkvision's range of smart detection features. These use
      advanced video analytics to allow a whole range of automation options. They
      include face detection, line crossing detection - even unattended baggage notifications.
      The cameras use power-over-ethernet, so they draw power from the recorder instead
      of needing individual power supplies.\r\n\r\nThe included Network Video Recorder
      (NVR) features your choice of hard drive storage. The NVR actually has two hard
      drive bays, allowing you a ridiculous maximum storage capacity of 12TB! It actually
      has 8 POE ports. This means that you connect 4 cameras at full 4K resolution,
      or drop the quality down to \"only\" 1080p to add an additional 4. Connect the
      NVR to your router to configure the remote access feature, letting you watch
      live or recorded footage from your cameras from anywhere using a PC, Mac or
      mobile device."
