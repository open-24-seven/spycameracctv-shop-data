    description: "Hikvision's HiWatch IP range brings the amazing image quality of
      their industry leading professional security cameras to the home user, providing
      \ easy to use kit at a price tag that doesn't break the bank. As part of this
      range, this 4 dome camera IP system boasts 4 megapixels (2688x1520) of recording
      resolution - twice the subject detail of even 1080p Full HD. \r\n\r\nThe cameras
      are housed inside IP67 rated weatherproof casings, allowing them to be used
      indoors or outdoors, exposed to the worst of the elements. Each camera is fitted
      with IR LEDs to provide 30m of clear night vision illumination, making them
      a perfect choice to watch over the outside of a house with a large garden or
      driveway. The cameras use Power-over-Ethernet (PoE), so they draw power from
      the network cable, removing the need for setting up annoying separate mains
      supplies.\r\n\r\nAs well as the cameras, the kit includes everything you need
      to get them up and running, including 10m network cables and an HD recorder
      to control the system. The recorder (or NVR) is able to record each camera at
      full 4MP resolution, so you won't lose a pixel of quality. In addition to a
      host of adjustable motion detection and scheduling settings, it also allows
      remote access. Once configured to your network, this can let you view or record
      footage from anywhere using a smartphone, tablet or PC.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
