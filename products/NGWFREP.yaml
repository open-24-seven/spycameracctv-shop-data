    description: "Wifi cameras provide more freedom than any other type of CCTV, using
      your home or office wireless network to transmit video that can be viewed from
      anywhere in the world. One limitation, however, is that most buildings will
      have \"Wifi dead zones\", or spots that have very little signal. If you are
      using our Green Feathers Wifi bird box camera, then it may also be a problem
      getting a good signal all the way at the back of your garden where the nest
      box is installed.\r\n\r\nThis Netgear Wifi range extender is a cheap and easy
      solution, simply picking up your existing signal and boosting it. By connecting
      it to a mains socket roughly half way between the router and the camera, you
      can hugely increase the coverage and signal quality. The device supports high
      speed networks up to 300Mbps, and has a simple set up guide, so you don't need
      extensive networking knowledge to get it up and running!"
