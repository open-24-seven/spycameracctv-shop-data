    description: "This slim 8GB i-Series USB 2.0 memory stick is a simple storage
      solution for any kind of digital file. It's a perfect way to back up footage
      from your CCTV recorder's hard drive, letting you easily transfer clips to a
      computer, or pass them on to the authorities. It's also perfect as general storage,
      providing an easy place to put your photos, music, documents or any other file
      type.\r\n\r\nThe stick is protected by a durable case, and a clear plastic dust
      cover helps keep the contacts on the connector clean when it's in your bag or
      pocket. As a USB 2.0 device, there is no setup required, just plug it straight
      into your comuputer and drag & drop files onto it!"
