    description: "Ever since we started selling covert security solutions, alarm clocks
      have been one of our best selling types of camouflage camera. They can easily
      be left in plain sight on a desk, night stand or shelf, recording with a clear
      view of the room. Because of this they're one of the best options for monitoring
      a relative's carers.\r\n\r\nThis spy alarm clock has an extra trick up it's
      sleeve - a passive infrared (PIR) detector, that can use a nearby subject's
      body heat to trigger recording. This not only provides far more accurate motion
      detection, but allows the camera to remain on standby for up to 9 days on a
      single charge. Footage is recorded in 1920x1080 HD, for video clips with plenty
      of subject detail. The kit includes a 16GB MicroSD card to hold recordings,
      although it can work with cards up to 32GB. "
