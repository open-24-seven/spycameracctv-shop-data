    description: "<strong>B-grade item 20% off RRP</strong>\r\nThis product may be
      a customer return or ex-display. The packaging will have been opened but the
      contents have been fully tested. It might have minor cosmetic defects.\r\n\r\nThis
      kit boasts a host of unique security features, all controlled by one central
      device, so there's no need to trail cables everywhere. This makes it ideal for
      people looking for a first security kit who want to avoid a stressful setup.\r\n\r\nUniquely,
      the cameras are capable of recording at an impressive 720p HD resolution, previously
      unheard of for wireless CCTV kits! The extra detail this records means the resulting
      security footage will be much more useful if you have to go back and review
      it should the worst happen. If you want to expand the system at a later date,
      up to 2 cameras are supported at full 720p resolution, or up to 4 at standard
      definition. The camera also has a built in PIR sensor, allowing it to detect
      a subject's body heat, and use it to trigger recording- a much more reliable
      system than standard motion detection! The feature packed camera is finished
      off with a ring of IR LEDs, providing clear night vision of subjects up to 10m
      away.\r\n\r\nFootage from the camera is then transmitted to the recorder/monitor
      using advanced Digital Wireless technology. This pairs the devices together
      in order to send the video signal across a wide range of frequencies, both helping
      reduce the risk of wireless interference and making sure that no other users
      can pick up your camera's signal.\r\n\r\nThe recording device itself combines
      a wireless receiver with a MicroSD DVR and a 9\" colour LCD. This means everything
      you need to record and view the cameras is in one single device. To make it
      even more versatile, the screen has an internal battery, allowing you to unplug
      the device and move it around your house without any constrictions. Additional
      features also include an automatic power save function and even a talkback mode,
      using the small speaker built into the camera. Footage is stored to the built-in
      MicroSD card slot (supports up to 64GB, card not included), capable of holding
      many days' worth of footage. For mobile security, connecting the device to your
      internet router and scanning the included QR code lets you watch live footage
      from your camera on a smartphone or tablet."
