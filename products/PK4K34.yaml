    description: "1080p CCTV equipment is now cheaper than ever before, but even these
      great cameras still do not record enough detail for some applications. Because
      of this, our range of Hikvision 4K CCTV systems is designed to provide you with
      some of the highest resolution recording available on the market, whilst still
      being affordable for small business or home users. The cameras record 3840x2160
      (8 megapixel)video - that's <i>4 times</i> the subject detail of 1080p. They're
      ideal for tasks such as identifying faces, tracking people in a crowd, or monitoring
      small subjects across a large area.\r\n\r\nThe 4 included cameras all feature
      50m infrared night vision, letting them clearly record 24/7 in large outdoor
      spaces. They're protected by IP67 rated weatherproof houses, making them robust
      enough for outdoor installation. As part of Hikvision's latest range of IP cameras,
      they also boast a selection of advanced smart features. These include face detection,
      intrusion detection and line cross detection. They even have an unattended baggage
      detection setting! \r\n\r\nThe system also features a Power over Ethernet (PoE)
      recorder, which can send power down the cable to each camera. This helps keep
      installation simple by removing the need for additional power supplies. The
      recorder can then be connected to your router to allow remote access via PC,
      Mac or mobile device. Once configured, this allows you to log in and securely
      watch your cameras from anywhere in the world. The recorder comes pre-fitted
      with your choice of hard drive storage\r\n\r\n"
