    description: "<strong>B-grade product</strong>\r\nThis item is likely a customer
      return or an ex-display model that is in a good condition but may have some
      light cosmetic damage. \r\n\r\nOur HD Bird Box Camera allows you to watch the
      inside of your bird box over the internet via a smartphone or tablet â€“ all
      in incredible HD! There's no other bird box camera on the market that is true
      HD or accessible over the internet. You can plug it straight into your router
      and log in via a mobile or iPad to view live wherever you are.\r\n\r\nThe camera
      itself has also been upgraded, now recording in 960p (1280x960) HD, providing
      the clearest possible image of the birds at home in the nest. IR LEDs provide
      clear night vision for recording after dark and if there is good lighting conditions
      then the camera can record in colour. A wide angle lens also helps get everything
      in the frame, even in the most compact nest boxes.\r\n\r\nThe kit includes a
      20m Cat6 ethernet cable with waterproof connector, which runs straight from
      the camera to your router or network switch. Once configured via an app, you
      can then view the camera live on your mobile device. If viewing using a PC,
      then the CMS software lets you record footage, even using motion detection and
      scheduling."
