      garden from the comfort of your house. See the birds up close with our camera
      designed especially for bird nesting boxes. Featuring a wide-angle lens and
      night vision, the camera is ideally suited to cosy bird boxes. Video and audio
      is sent down the included 20 metre cable from where the camera is also powered.
      With 700 TV line video and adjustable focus the camera allows you to capture
      the best images possible.   \r\n\r\nIn this kit we have included our USB Video
      Capture Device, which allows you to record to your Windows PC without the need

      recording options such as motion detection and scheduled recording so that you
      can configure recording to your specification. Footage is recorded to the PC's
      hard drive so that you can return to view it at anytime. Furthermore you can
      export footage to upload to YouTube and back up to the cloud.\r\n\r\nTo download
