    description: This pre-cut high grade Cat5e cable is ideal for use with IP security
      systems, or any other network connection that requires lots of bandwidth. The
      waterproof outer jacket enables them to be installed outdoors. Removing the
      RJ45 connectors lets you use it as a data cable for PTZ controls.
