    description: "Specially designed for those tricky applications where discretion
      is a priority, this HD smoke detector camera is packed with professional security
      features. Thanks to Wifi connectivity, you can easily access the camera remotely
      from a PC or mobile, all without any suspicious network cables leading from
      the device. This makes it ideally suited to jobs such as monitoring an office,
      or monitoring for theft in a stock room.\r\n\r\nHidden inside the detector housing,
      the camera captures clear and sharp footage in 1920x1080 Full HD resolution,
      ensuring plenty of usable subject detail. Everything is recorded through a tiny
      pinhole lens behind a grate in the side of the detector, out of view of prying
      eyes. The imaging chip is sensitive to light levels as low as 0.5 lux, and can
      even be paired with external infra red illuminators for use in total darkness.\r\n\r\nAs
      an IP camera, the camera connects to your network router, letting you log in
      and view live or recorded footage from anywhere using a PC or mobile device.
      Crucially, the camera works with Wifi, so once it's configured you can unplug
      it from your router, and leave it running with nothing but the power cable still
      connected. The built-in MicroSD card slot also lets you record footage directly
      to the camera, without needing an external recorder. It boasts a full suite
      of CCTV recording options, including motion detection and scheduling. Please
      note - card not included."
