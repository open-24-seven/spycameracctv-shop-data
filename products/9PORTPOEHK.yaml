    description: "Power over Ethernet (PoE) lets you power devices such as IP cameras
      directly from their network connection, removing the need for annoying extra
      power supplies. This 9 port PoE network switch from Hikvision can connect up
      to 8 IP security cameras to your network, whilst also powering them. It's a
      great way to manage the increased data from streaming HD cameras.\r\n\r\nThe
      PoE provides a stable and reliable power supply for your security system, with
      surge protection and up to 30W per port. The PoE ports can also automatically
      switch between 10 & 100Mbps connections."
