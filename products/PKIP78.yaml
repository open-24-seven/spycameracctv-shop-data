    description: "This 8-camera 4-megapixel security system from Hikvision boasts
      network IP turret cameras that record amazing quality footage with even more
      detail than 1080p Full HD. It's a fantastic choice for demanding jobs such as
      monitoring a larger shop.\r\n\r\nThe 8 cameras included in this kit feature
      night vision with a range of 30 metres, allowing round the clock monitoring.
      They are also IP66 rated, allowing for installation in exposed outdoor locations.
      You can be sure of no quality less as the cameras record efficiently-compressed
      digital footage and send it down data cables directly to the recorder.\r\n\r\nWith
      regards to the recorder, a professional grade Hikvision NVR, capable of recording
      the cameras at full resolution, is the workhorse. Handily, the recorder features
      Power-over-Ethernet (PoE), letting it send power to the cameras over the network
      cables used to connect the kit together. As with all of our CCTV recorders,
      it's also kitted out with a complete suite of recording modes, including motion
      detection and 7-day scheduling. Connect the NVR to your network router to enable
      remote access. Once configured this enables you to watch live or recorded footage
      from anywhere using a PC or mobile device. This means that you can keep one
      eye on your property, no matter where you are. \r\n\r\n<em>Some basic networking
      knowledge is recommended for configuring the remote access. If you need a bit
      of help getting it running then we also have a great remote setup service to
      get it all sorted for you. <a href=\"https://www.spycameracctv.com/spycamera/gold-support-remote-setup-online-viewing-mobile-access\">See
