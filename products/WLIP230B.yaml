    description: "Here at SpyCameraCCTV, we have been supplying farmers and breeders
      with bespoke CCTV solutions since 2009. Our kits help take the stress out of
      calving, lambing and foaling by allowing you to keep a close eye on all of your
      animals from one place without having to constantly trudge out to barns and
      sheds. This <strong>HD lambing camera kit</strong> is the very latest in this
      range, combining a 1080p Full HD IP camera with a powerful wifi transmitter,
      letting you view the camera over unprecedented distances.\r\n\r\nUnlike other
      farm CCTV systems that use traditional analogue cameras, this pack uses a Hikvision
      IP camera, recording digital footage and then sending it down a network cable.
      This allows a massive step up in image quality, with the camera recording 1920x1080p
      HD. Not only that, but because the camera connects straight to your router,
      you can easily log in to your camera to view live footage using a PC, smartphone
      or tablet. This makes it easier than ever to monitor your animals during this
      stressful time of year.\r\n\r\nBecause the kit uses an IP camera, it also means
      we can use more advanced wireless technology. This kit includes a set of WiFi
      transmitters. When they have a direct line of sight, these powerful devices
      can transmit and receiver signals from the camera at distances <strong>up to
      5km</strong>. Because they need a completely clear sight line in order to work,
      the kit includes pole mounts, so you can set them at an elevated height away
      from obstructions."
