    description: "Combining the no-compromise, crystal clear image quality of an HD
      IP camera with the simple plug and play installation of traditional analogue
      CCTV, this Hikvision Turbo HD TVI dome camera is a fantastic tool for home or
      business security. \r\n\r\nAs one of the largest and most trusted names in video
      surveillance, Hikvision have developed their Turbo HD TVI range for customers
      who simply need the best image quality without the hassle of setting up IP cameras
      over a network. The camera can record in sharp 1080p HD (2 megapixels), connecting
      to a recorder using standard plug-and-play BNC connectors. It even supports
      Power-over-Coax (PoC), letting it draw power from a compatible DVR over the
      RG59 cable, and removing the need for an additional power supply.\r\n\r\nThe
      camera itself is housed in a compact but tough metal dome housing, rated IP66
      weather proof to protect it from the elements in even the most open locations.
      A ring of powerful infra-red LEDs provide night vision illumination for subjects
      up to 20m away, ensuring your property can stay secure around the clock. When
      used with a compatible DVR, you can also adjust a wide variety of image quality
      settings, including noise reduction and backlight correction- especially helpful
      when installed in areas with high contrast lighting such as doorways.\r\n\r\nThese
      features combine to make this range one of our best options for business or
      commercial security. Of course, you don't need to take our word for it- check
      out the videos section for real world samples of just how impressive the camera's
      footage can be."
